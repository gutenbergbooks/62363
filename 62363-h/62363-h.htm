<h3>
CHAPTER I.
</h3>

<p>
"I'm going to stay with the three
Miss Miners at the Trehearnes' place,"
said Louis Lawrence, looking down
into the blue water as he leaned over
the rail of the <i>Sappho</i>, on the sunny
side of the steamer.  "They're taking
care of Miss Trehearne while her
mother is away at Karlsbad with
Mr. Trehearne," he added, in further
explanation.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered Professor Knowles,
his companion.  "Yes," he repeated
vaguely, a moment later.
</p>

<p>
"It's fun for the three Miss Miners,
having such a place all to themselves
for the summer," continued young
Lawrence.  "It's less amusing for Miss
Trehearne, I daresay.  I suppose I'm
asked to enliven things.  It can't be
exactly gay in their establishment."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know any of them," observed
the Professor, who was a Boston
man.  "The probability is that I never
shall.  Who are the three Miss Miners,
and who is Miss Trehearne?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;you don't know them!"  Lawrence's
voice expressed his surprise that
there should be any one who did not
know the ladies in question.  "Well&mdash;they're
three old maids, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me, I don't know.  Old
maid is such a vague term.  How old
must a maid be, to be an old maid?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;it isn't age that makes old
maids.  It's the absence of youth.
They're born so."
</p>

<p>
"A pleasing paradox," remarked the
Professor, his exaggerated jaw seeming
to check the uneasy smile, as it
attacked the gravity of his colourless thin
lips.
</p>

<p>
His head, in the full face view, was
not too large for his body, which, in
the two dimensions of length and
breadth, was well proportioned.  The
absence of the third dimension, that is,
of bodily thickness, was very apparent
when he was seen sideways, while the
exaggeration of the skull was also
noticeable only in profile.  The forehead
and the long delicate jaw were
unnaturally prominent; the ear was set much
too far back, and there was no
development over the eyes, while the nose
was small, thin, and sharp, as though
cut out of letter paper.
</p>

<p>
"It's not a paradox," said Lawrence,
whose respect for professorial
statements was small.  "The three Miss
Miners were old maids before they
were born.  They're not particularly
old, except Cordelia.  She must be
over forty.  Augusta is the youngest&mdash;about
thirty-two, I should think.  Then
there's the middle one&mdash;she's
Elizabeth, you know&mdash;she's no particular
age.  Cordelia must have been
pretty&mdash;in a former state.  Lots of brown
hair and beautiful teeth.  But she has
the religious smile&mdash;what they put on
when they sing hymns, don't you know?
It's chronic.  Good teeth and
resignation did it.  She's good all through,
but you get all through her so soon!
Elizabeth's clever&mdash;comparatively.
She's brown, and round, and fat, and
ugly.  I'd like to paint her portrait.
She's really by far the most attractive.
As for Augusta&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well?  What about Augusta?"
enquired the Professor, as Lawrence
paused.
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;she's awful!  She's the
accomplished one."
</p>

<p>
"I thought you said that the middle
one&mdash;what's her name?&mdash;was the
cleverest."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but cleverness never goes
with what they call accomplishments,"
answered the young man.  "I've heard
of great men playing the flute, but I
never heard of anybody who was
'musical' and came to anything&mdash;especially
women.  Fancy Cleopatra playing the
piano&mdash;or Catherine the Great painting
a salad of wild flowers on a fan!
Can you?  Or Semiramis sketching a
lap dog on a cushion!"
</p>

<p>
"What very strange ideas you have!"
observed the Professor, gravely.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence did not say anything in
reply, but looked out over the blue
water at the dark green islands of the
deep bay as the <i>Sappho</i> paddled along,
beating up a wake of egg-white froth.
He was glad that Professor Knowles
was going over to the other side to
dwell amongst the placid inhabitants
of North East Harbour, where the joke
dieth not, even at an advanced age;
where there are people who believe in
Ruskin and swear by Herbert Spencer,
who coin words ending in 'ism,' and
intellectually subsist on the 'ologies'
with the notable exception of theology.
Lawrence had once sat at the Professor's
feet, at Harvard, unwillingly,
indeed, but not without indirect profit.
They had met to-day in the train, and
it was not probable that they should
meet again in the course of the
summer, unless they particularly sought
one another's society.
</p>

<p>
They had nothing in common.  Lawrence
was an artist, or intended to be
one, and had recently returned from
abroad, after spending three years in
Paris.  By parentage he belonged to
New York.  He had been christened
Louis because his mother was of French
extraction and had an uncle of that
name, who might be expected to do
something handsome for her son.  Louis
Lawrence was now about five and
twenty years of age, was possessed of
considerable talent, and of no particular
worldly goods.  His most important
and valuable possession, indeed, was
his character, which showed itself in
all he said and did.
</p>

<p>
There is something problematic about
the existence of a young artist who is
in earnest, which alone is an attraction
in the eyes of women.  The odds are
ten to one, of course, that he will never
accomplish anything above the average,
but that one-tenth chance is not to be
despised, for it is the possibility of a
well-earned celebrity, perhaps of
greatness.  The one last step, out of
obscurity into fame, is generally the only
one of which the public knows anything,
sees anything, or understands anything;
and no one can tell when, if ever, that
one step may be taken.  There is a
constant interest in expecting it, and in
knowing of its possibility, which lends
the artist's life a real charm in his own
eyes and the eyes of others.  And very
often it turns out that the charm is all
the life has to recommend it.
</p>

<p>
The young man who had just given
Professor Knowles an account of his
hostesses was naturally inclined to be
communicative, which is a weakness,
though he was also frank, which is a
virtue.  He was a very slim young man,
and might have been thought to be in
delicate health, for he was pale and
thin in the face.  The features were
long and finely chiselled, and the
complexion was decidedly dark.  He would
have looked well in a lace ruffle, with
flowing curls.  But his hair was short,
and he wore rough grey clothes and
an unobtrusive tie.  The highly arched
black eyebrows gave his expression
strength, but the very minute, dark
mustache which shaded the upper lip
was a little too evidently twisted and
trained.  That was the only outward
sign of personal vanity, however, and
was not an offensive one, though it gave
him a foreign air which Professor
Knowles disliked, but which the three
Miss Miners thought charming.  His
manner pleased them, too; for he was
always just as civil to them as though
they had been young and pretty and
amusing, which is more than can be
said of the majority of modern youths.
His conversation occasionally shocked
them, it is true; but the shock was a
mild one and agreeably applied, so that
they were willing to undergo it frequently.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence was not thinking of the
Miss Miners as he watched the dark
green islands.  If he had thought of
them at all during the last half-hour, it
had been with a certain undefined
gratitude to them for being the means of
allowing him to spend a fortnight in
the society of Fanny Trehearne.
</p>

<p>
Professor Knowles had not moved
from his side during the long silence.
Lawrence looked up and saw that he
was still there, his extraordinary profile
cut out against the cloudless sky.
</p>

<p>
"Will you smoke?" inquired Lawrence,
offering him a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
"No, thank you&mdash;certainly not
cigarettes," answered the Professor, with a
superior air.  "You were telling me
all about the Miss Miners," he
continued; for though he knew none of
them, he was of a curious disposition.
"You spoke of a Miss Trehearne, I
think."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered the young man.
"Do you know her?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no.  It's an unusual name,
that's all.  Are they New York people?"
</p>

<p>
Lawrence smiled at the idea that
any one should ask such a question.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course," he answered.
"New York&mdash;since the Flood."
</p>

<p>
"And Miss Trehearne is the only
daughter?" enquired the Professor,
inquisitively.
</p>

<p>
"She has a brother&mdash;Randolph,"
replied Lawrence, rather shortly; for
he was suddenly aware that there was
no particular reason why he should
talk about the Trehearnes.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, they're relations of the
Miners," observed the Professor.
</p>

<p>
"That's the reason why Miss
Trehearne has them to stay with her.
Excuse me&mdash;I can't get a light in
this wind."
</p>

<p>
Thereupon Lawrence turned away
and got under the lee of the deck
saloon, leaving the Professor to
himself.  Having lighted his cigarette,
the artist went forward and stood in
the sharp head-breeze that seemed to
blow through and through him,
disinfecting his whole being from the hot,
close air of the train he had left half
an hour earlier.
</p>

<p>
Bar Harbour, in common speech,
includes Frenchman's Bay, the island
of Mount Desert, and the other small
islands lying near it,&mdash;an extensive
tract of land and sea.  As a matter of
fact, the name belongs to the little
harbour between Bar Island and Mount
Desert, together with the village which
has grown to be the centre of
civilization, since the whole place has
become fashionable.  Earth, sky, and
water are of the north,&mdash;hard, bright,
and cold.  In artists' slang, there is no
atmosphere.  The dark green islands,
as one looks at them, seem to be
almost before the foreground.  The
picture is beautiful, and some people call
it grand; but it lacks depth.  There is
something fiercely successful about the
colour of it, something brilliantly
self-reliant.  It suggests a certain type of
handsome woman&mdash;of the kind that
need neither repentance nor cosmetics,
and are perfectly sure of the fact,
whose virtue is too cold to be kind,
and whose complexion is not shadowed
by passion, nor softened by suffering,
nor even washed pale with tears.  Only
the sea is eloquent.  The deep-breathing
tide runs forward to the feet of the
over-perfect, heartless earth, to linger
and plead love's story while he may;
then sighing sadly, sweeps back unsatisfied,
baring his desolate bosom to her
loveless scorn.
</p>

<p>
The village, the chief centre, lies by
the water's edge, facing the islands
which enclose the natural harbour.
It was and is a fishing village, like
many another on the coast.  In the
midst of it, vast wooden hotels, four
times as high as the houses nearest to
them, have sprung up to lodge fashion
in six-storied discomfort.  The effect
is astonishing; for the blatant architect,
gesticulating in soft wood and ranting
in paint, as it were, has sketched an
evil dream of mediævalism, incoherent
with itself and with the very common-place
facts of the village street.  There,
also, in Mr. Bee's shop window, are
plainly visible the more or less startling
covers of the newest books, while from
on high frowns down the counterfeit
presentment of battlements and turrets,
and of such terrors as lent like interest
when novels were not, neither was the
slightest idea of the short story yet
conceived.
</p>

<p>
But behind all and above all rise the
wooded hills, which are neither modern
nor ancient, but eternal.  And in them
and through them there is secret
sweetness, and fragrance, and much that is
gentle and lovely&mdash;in the heart of the
defiantly beautiful earth-woman with
her cold face, far beyond the reach
of her tide-lover, and altogether out of
hearing of his sighs and complaining
speeches.  There grow in endless
greenness the white pines and the
pitch pines, the black spruce and the
white; there droops the feathery larch
by the creeping yew, and there gleam
the birches, yellow, white, and grey;
the sturdy red oak spreads his arms
to the scarlet maple, and the witch
hazel rustles softly in the mysterious
forest breeze.  There, buried in the
wood's bosom, bloom and blossom
the wild flowers, and redden the
blushing berries in unseen succession, from
middle June to late September&mdash;violets
first, and wild iris, strawberries
and raspberries, blueberries and
blackberries; short-lived wild roses and
tender little blue-bells, red lilies,
goldenrod and clematis, in the confusion of
nature's loveliest order.
</p>

<p>
All this Lawrence knew, and remembered,
guessing at what he could neither
remember nor know, with an artist's
facility for filling up the unfinished
sketch left on the mind by one
impression.  He had been at Bar
Harbour three years earlier, and had
wandered amongst the woods and
pottered along the shore in a skiff.
But he had been alone then and had
stopped in the mediæval hotel, a
rather solitary, thinking unit amidst
the horde of thoughtless summer
nomads, designated by the clerk at
the desk as 'Number a hundred and
twenty-three,' and a candidate for a
daily portion of the questionable
dinner at the hotel table.  It was to be
different this time, he thought, as he
watched for the first sight of the pier
when the <i>Sappho</i> rounded Bar Island.
The Trehearnes had not been at their
house three years ago, and Fanny
Trehearne had been then not quite
sixteen, just groping her way from the
schoolroom to the world, and quite
beneath his young importance&mdash;even
had she been at Bar Harbour to
wander among the woods with him.
Things had changed, now.  He was
not quite sure that in her girlish heart
she did not consider him beneath her
notice.  She was straight and tall&mdash;almost
as tall as he, and she was proud,
if she was not pretty, and she carried
her head as high as the handsomest.
Moreover, she was rich, and Louis
Lawrence was at present phenomenally
poor, with a rather distant chance of
inheriting money.  These were some
of the excellent reasons why fate had
made him fall in love with her, though
none of them accounted for the fact
that she had encouraged him, and had
suggested to the Miss Miners that it
would be very pleasant to have him
come and stay a fortnight in July.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Sappho</i> slowed down, stopped,
backed, and made fast to the wooden
pier, and as she swung round, Lawrence
saw Fanny Trehearne standing a little
apart from the group of people who
had come down to meet their own
friends or to watch other people
meeting theirs.  The young girl was
evidently looking for him, and he took off
his hat and waved it about erratically
to attract her attention.  When she
saw him, she nodded with a faint smile
and moved one step nearer to the
gangway, to wait until he should come
on shore with the crowd.
</p>

<p>
She had a quiet, business-like way of
moving, as though she never changed
her position without a purpose.  As
Lawrence came along, trying to gain
on the stream of passengers with whom
he was moving, he kept his eyes fixed
on her face, wondering whether the
expression would change when he
reached her and took her hand.  When
the moment came, the change was very
slight.
</p>

<p>
"I like you&mdash;you're punctual," she
said.  "Come along!"
</p>

<p>
"I've got some traps, you know,"
he answered, hesitating.
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;there's the expressman.
Give him your checks."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap02"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
</h3>

<p>
"They've all gone out in Mr. Brown's
cat-boat&mdash;so I came alone," observed
Miss Trehearne, when the expressman
had been interviewed.
</p>

<p>
"Who are 'all'?" asked Lawrence.
"Just the three Miss Miners?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Just the three Miss Miners."
</p>

<p>
"I thought you might have somebody
stopping with you."
</p>

<p>
"No.  Nobody but you.  Why do
you say 'stopping' instead of 'staying'?
I don't like it."
</p>

<p>
"Then I won't say it again," answered
Lawrence, meekly.  "Why do you
object to it, though?"
</p>

<p>
"You're not an Englishman, so
there's no reason why you shouldn't
speak English.  Here's the buckboard.
Can you drive?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;well&mdash;yes," replied the
young man, rather doubtfully, and
looking at the smart little turn-out.
</p>

<p>
Fanny Trehearne fixed her cool grey
eyes on his face with a critical expression.
</p>

<p>
"Can you ride?" she asked, pursuing
her examination.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes&mdash;that is&mdash;to some extent.
I'm not exactly a circus-rider, you
know&mdash;but I can get on."
</p>

<p>
"Most people can do that.  The
important thing is not to come off.
What can you do&mdash;anyway?  Are you
a good man in a boat?  You see I've
only met you in society.  I've never
seen you do anything."
</p>

<p>
"No," answered Lawrence.  "I'm
not a good man in a boat, as you call
it&mdash;except that I'm never sea-sick.  I
don't know anything about boats, if
you mean sail-boats.  I can row a
little&mdash;that's all."
</p>

<p>
"If you could 'row' as you call it,
you'd say you could 'pull an oar'&mdash;you
wouldn't talk about 'rowing.'  Well,
get in, and I'll drive."
</p>

<p>
There was not the least scorn in her
manner, at his inability to do all those
things which are to be done at Bar
Harbour if people do anything at all.
She had simply ascertained the fact as
a measure of safety.  It was not easy
to guess whether she despised him
for his lack of skill or not, but he was
inclined to think that she did, and he
made up his mind that he would get
up very early, and engage a sailor to go
out with him and teach him something
about boats.  The resolution was half
unconscious, for he was really thinking
more of her than of himself just then.
To tell the truth, he did not attach so
much importance to any of the things
she had mentioned as to feel greatly
humiliated by his own ignorance.
</p>

<p>
"After all," said Miss Trehearne, as
Lawrence took his seat beside her, "it
doesn't matter.  And it's far better to
be frank, and say at once that you don't
know, than to pretend that you do, and
then try to steer and drown one, or to
drive and then break my neck.  Only
one rather wonders where you were
brought up, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;I was brought up somehow,"
answered Lawrence, vaguely.  "I don't
exactly remember."
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't matter," returned his
companion, in a reassuring tone.
</p>

<p>
"No.  If you don't mind, I don't."
</p>

<p>
Fanny Trehearne laughed a little,
without looking at him, for she was
intent upon what she was doing.  It
was a part of her nature to fix her
attention upon whatever she had in
hand&mdash;a fact which must account for
a certain indifference in what she said.
Just then, too, she was crossing the
main street of the village, and there
were other vehicles moving about hither
and thither.  More than once she
nodded to an acquaintance, whom
Lawrence also recognized.
</p>

<p>
"It's much more civilized than it
was when I was here last," observed
Lawrence.  "There are lots of people
one knows."
</p>

<p>
"Much too civilized," answered the
young girl.  "I'm beginning to hate
it."
</p>

<p>
"I thought you liked society&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I?  What made you think so?"
</p>

<p>
This sort of question is often extremely
embarrassing.  Lawrence looked at
her thoughtfully, and wished that he had
not made his innocent remark, since
he was called upon to explain it.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," he replied at last.
"Somehow, I always associate you with
society, and dancing, and that sort of
thing."
</p>

<p>
"Do you?  It's very unjust."
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;it's not exactly a crime to
like society, is it?  Why are you so
angry?"
</p>

<p>
"I wish you wouldn't exaggerate!
It does not follow that I'm angry
because you're not fair to me."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't mean to be unfair.  How
you take one up!"
</p>

<p>
"Really, Mr. Lawrence&mdash;I think
it's you who are doing that!"
</p>

<p>
Miss Trehearne, having a stretch of
clear road before her, gave her pair
their heads for a moment, and the light
buckboard dashed briskly up the gentle
ascent.  Lawrence was watching her,
though she did not look at him, and
he thought he saw the colour deepen
in her sunburnt cheek, although her
grey eyes were as cool as ever.  She was
certainly not pretty, according to the
probable average judgment of younger
men.  Lawrence, himself, who was an
artist, wondered what he saw in her
face to attract him, since he could not
deny the attraction, and could not
attribute it altogether to expression nor
to the indirect effect of her character
acting upon his imagination.  He did
not like to believe, either, that the charm
was fictitious, and lay in a certain air of
superior smartness, the result of good
taste and plenty of money.  Anybody
could wear serge, and a more or less
nautical hat and gloves, just in the
fashionable degree of looseness or
tightness, as the case might be.  Anybody
who chose had the right to turn up a
veil over the brim of the aforesaid hat,
and anybody who did so stood a good
chance of being sunburnt.  Moreover,
as Lawrence well knew, there is a
quality of healthy complexion which
tans to a golden brown, very becoming
when the grey eyes have dark lashes,
but less so when, as in Fanny
Trehearne's case, the lashes and brows
are much lighter than the hair&mdash;almost
white, in fact.  It is not certain
whether the majority of human noses
turn up or down.  There was, however,
no doubt but that Fanny's turned up.
It was also apparent that she had
decidedly high cheek bones, a square
jaw, and a large mouth, with lips much
too even and too little curved for
beauty.  After all, her best points
were perhaps her eyes, her golden-brown
complexion, and her crisp, reddish
brown hair, which twisted itself
into sharp little curls wherever it was
not long enough to be smoothed.
With a little more regularity of feature,
Fanny Trehearne might have been
called a milkmaid beauty, so far as her
face was concerned.  Fortunately for
her, her looks were above or below
such faint praise.  It was doubtful
whether she would be said to have
charm, but she had individuality, since
those terms are in common use to
express gifts which escape definition.
</p>

<p>
A short silence followed her somewhat
indignant speech.  Then, the road
being still clear before her, she turned
and looked at Lawrence.  It was not
a mere glance of enquiry, it was
certainly not a tender glance, but her eyes
lingered with his for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Look here&mdash;are we going to quarrel?"
she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Is there any reason why we should?"
Lawrence smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Not if we agree," answered the
young girl, gravely, as she turned her
head from him again.
</p>

<p>
"That means that we shan't quarrel
if I agree with you, I suppose," observed
the young man.
</p>

<p>
"Well, why shouldn't you?" asked
Fanny, frankly.  "You may just as well,
you know.  You will in the end."
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!  You seem pretty sure of
that!" Lawrence laughed.
</p>

<p>
Fanny said nothing in reply, but
shortened the reins as the horses reached
the top of the hill.  Lawrence looked
down towards the sea.  The sun was
very low, and the water was turning from
sapphire to amaranth, while the dark
islands gathered gold into their green
depths.
</p>

<p>
"How beautiful it is!" exclaimed the
artist, not exactly from impulse, though
in real enjoyment, while consciously
hoping that his companion would say
something pleasant.
</p>

<p>
"Of course it's beautiful," she
answered.  "That's why I come here."
</p>

<p>
"I should put it in the opposite way,"
said Lawrence.
</p>

<p>
"How?"
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;it's beautiful because you
come here."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;that's ingenious!  You think
it's my mission to beautify landscapes."
</p>

<p>
"I thought that if I said something
pretty in the way of a compliment, we
shouldn't go on quarrelling."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Were we quarrelling?  I hadn't
noticed it."
</p>

<p>
"You said something about it a
moment ago," observed Lawrence, mildly.
</p>

<p>
"Did I?  You're an awfully literal
person.  By the bye, you know all the Miss
Miners, don't you?  I've forgotten."
</p>

<p>
"I believe I do.  There's Miss Miner
the elder&mdash;to begin with&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The oldest&mdash;since there are three,"
said Fanny, correcting him.  "Yes&mdash;she's
the one with the hair&mdash;and teeth."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and Miss Elizabeth&mdash;isn't that
her name?  The plainest&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And the nicest.  And Augusta&mdash;she's
the third.  Paints wild flowers
and plays the piano.  She's about my
age, I believe."
</p>

<p>
"Your age!  Why, she must be over
thirty!"
</p>

<p>
"No.  She's nineteen, still.  She's got
an anchor out to windward&mdash;against
the storm of time, you know.  She swings
a little with the tide, though."
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand," said Lawrence,
to whom nautical language was
incomprehensible.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind.  I only mean that she
does not want to grow old.  It's always
funny to see a person of nineteen who's
really over thirty."
</p>

<p>
Lawrence laughed a little.
</p>

<p>
"You're fond of them all, aren't you?"
he asked, presently.
</p>

<p>
"Of course!  They're my relations&mdash;how
could I help being fond of
them?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;yes," answered Lawrence,
vaguely.  "But they really are very
nice&mdash;people."
</p>

<p>
"Why do you hesitate?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  I couldn't say 'very
nice ladies,' could I?  And I shouldn't
exactly say 'very nice women'&mdash;and
'very nice people' sounds queer,
somehow, doesn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"And you wouldn't say 'very nice
old maids'&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not!"
</p>

<p>
"No.  It wouldn't be civil to me,
nor kind to them.  The truth is generally
unkind and usually rude.  Besides,
they love you."
</p>

<p>
"Me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  They rave about you, and
your looks, and your manners, and your
conversation, and your talents."
</p>

<p>
"The Dickens!  I'm flattered!  But
it's always the wrong people who like
one."
</p>

<p>
"Why the wrong people?" asked
Fanny Trehearne, not looking at him.
</p>

<p>
"Because all the liking in the world
from people one doesn't care for can't
make up for the not liking of the one
person one does care for."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;in that way.  It's rash to care
for only one person.  It's putting all
one's eggs into one basket."
</p>

<p>
"What an extraordinary sentiment!"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't mean it for sentiment."
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;I should think not!  Quite
the contrary, I should say."
</p>

<p>
"Quite," affirmed Fanny, gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Quite?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;almost quite."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;'almost' quite?"
</p>

<p>
"It's the same thing."
</p>

<p>
"Not to me."
</p>

<p>
The young girl would not turn her
attention from her horses, though in
Lawrence's inexpert opinion she could
have done so with perfect safety just
then, and without impropriety.  The
most natural and innocent curiosity
should have prompted her to look into
his eyes for a moment, if only to see
whether he were in earnest or not.
He would certainly not have thought
her a flirt if she had glanced kindly at
him.  But she looked resolutely at the
horses' heads.
</p>

<p>
"Here we are!" she exclaimed suddenly.
</p>

<p>
With a sharp turn to the left the
buckboard swept through the open
gate, the off horse breaking into a
canter which Fanny instantly checked.
The near wheels passed within a foot
of the gatepost.
</p>

<p>
"Wasn't that rather close?" asked Lawrence.
</p>

<p>
"Why?  There was lots of room.
Are you nervous?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose I am, since you say so."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't say so.  I asked."
</p>

<p>
"And I answered," said Lawrence, tartly.
</p>

<p>
"How sensitive you are!  You act
as though I had called you a coward."
</p>

<p>
"I thought you meant to.  It sounded
rather like it."
</p>

<p>
"You have no right to think that I
mean things which I haven't said,"
answered the young girl.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, very well.  I apologize for
thinking that what you said meant
anything."
</p>

<p>
"Don't lose your temper&mdash;don't
be a spoilt baby!"
</p>

<p>
Lawrence said nothing, and they
reached the house in silence.  Fanny
was not mistaken in calling him
sensitive, though he was by no means so
nervous, perhaps, as she seemed ready
to believe.  She had a harsh way of
saying things which, spoken with a
smile, could not have given offence,
and Lawrence was apt to attach
real importance to her careless
speeches.  He felt himself out of his
element from the first, in a place where
he might be expected to do things in
which he could not but show an
awkward inexperience, and he was ready
to resent anything like the suggestion
that timidity was at the root of his
ignorance, or was even its natural result.
</p>

<p>
His face was unnecessarily grave as
he held out his hand to help Fanny
down from the buckboard, and she
neither touched it nor looked at him
as she sprang to the ground.
</p>

<p>
"Go into the library, and we'll have
tea," she said, without turning her head,
as she entered the house before him.
"I'll be down in a moment."
</p>

<p>
She pointed carelessly to the open
door and went through the hall in the
direction of the staircase.  Lawrence
entered the room alone.
</p>

<p>
The house was very large; for the
Trehearnes were rich people, and liked
to have their friends with them in
considerable numbers.  Moreover, they
had bought land in Bar Harbour in days
when it had been cheap, and had built
their dwelling commodiously, in the
midst of a big lot which ran down from
the road to the sea.  With the instinct
of a man who has been obliged to live
in New York, squeezed in, as it were,
between tall houses on each side,
Mr. Trehearne had given himself the luxury,
in Bar Harbour, of a house as wide and
as deep as he could possibly desire,
and only two stories high.
</p>

<p>
The library was in the southwest
corner of the house, opening on the
south side upon a deep verandah
from which wooden steps descended to
the shrubbery, and having windows to
the west, which overlooked the broad
lawn.  The latter was enclosed by tall
trees.  The winding avenue led in a
northerly direction to the main road.
At the east end of the house, the offices
ran out towards the boundary of the
Trehearnes' land, and beyond them,
among the trees, there was a small
yard enclosed by a lattice of wood
eight or ten feet high.
</p>

<p>
The library was the principal room
on the ground floor, and was really larger
than the drawing-room which followed it
along the line of the south verandah,
though it seemed smaller from being
more crowded with furniture.  As
generally happens in the country, it
had become a sort of common room in
which everybody preferred to sit.  The
drawing-room had been almost
abandoned of late, the three Miss Miners
being sociable beings, unaccustomed to
magnificence in their own homes, and
averse to being alone with it anywhere.
They felt that the drawing-room was too
fine for them, and by tacit consent
they chose the library for their general
trysting-place and tea camp when they
were indoors.  Mrs. Trehearne, who
was, perhaps, a little too fond of
splendour, would have smiled at the idea as
she thought of her gorgeously brocaded
reception rooms in New York; but
Fanny had simple tastes, like her
father, and agreed with her old-maid
cousins in preferring the plain, dark
woodwork, the comfortable leathern
chairs, and the backs of the books, to
the dreary wilderness of expensive rugs
and unnecessary gilding which lay
beyond.  For the sake of coolness, the
doors were usually opened between the
rooms.

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
</h3>

<p>
The weather was warm.  By contrast
with the cool air of the bay he
had lately crossed, it seemed hot to
Lawrence when he entered the library.
Barely glancing at the room, he went
straight to one of the doors which
opened upon the verandah, and going
out, sat down discontentedly in a big
cushioned straw chair.  It was very
warm, and it seemed suddenly very
still.  In the distance he could hear
the wheels of the buckboard in the
avenue, as the groom took it round to
the stables, and out of the close
shrubbery he caught the sharp, dry sound of
footsteps rapidly retreating along a
concealed cinder path.  The air scarcely
stirred the creeper which climbed up
one of the pillars of the verandah and
festooned its way, curtain-like, in both
directions to the opposite ends.  On
his right he could see the broad,
sloping lawn, all shadowed now by the tall
trees beyond.  Without looking directly
at it, he felt that the vivid green of the
grass was softened and that there must
be gold in the tops of the trees.  The
sensation was restful, but his eyes stared
vacantly at the deep shrubbery which
began at the foot of the verandah steps
and stretched away under the spruces
at his left.
</p>

<p>
He was exceedingly discontented,
though he had just arrived, or, perhaps,
for that very reason among many other
minor ones.  He had never had any
cause to expect from Fanny Trehearne
anything in the way of sentiment, but
he was none the less persuaded that he
had a moral right to look for something
more than chaff and good-natured
hospitality, spiced with such vigorous
reproof as "don't be a spoilt baby."
</p>

<p>
The words rankled.  He was asking
himself just then whether he was a
"spoilt baby" or not.  It was of great
importance to him to know the truth.
If he was a spoilt baby, of course
Miss Trehearne had a right to say so if
she liked, though the expression was
not complimentary.  But if not, she
was monstrously unjust.  He did not
deny that the accusation might be well
founded; for he was modest as well as
sensitive, and did not think very highly
of himself at present, though he hoped
great things for the future, and believed
that he was to be a famous artist.
</p>

<p>
The more he told himself that he had
no right to expect anything of Fanny,
the more thoroughly convinced he
became that his right existed, and that
she was trampling upon it.  She had
ordered him into the library in a very
peremptory and high-and-mighty fashion
to wait for her, regardless of the
fact that he had travelled twenty-four
hours, and had acquired the prerogative
right of the traveller to soap and water
before all else.  No doubt he was quite
presentable, since the conditions of
modern railways had made it possible
to come in clean, or comparatively so,
from a longish run.  But the ancient
traditions ought not to be swept out of
the way, Louis thought, and the right
of scrubbing subsisted still.  She might
at least have given him a hint as to the
whereabouts of his room, since she had
left him to himself for a quarter of an
hour.  She had not been gone four
minutes yet, but Louis made it fifteen,
and fifteen it was to be, in his
estimation.
</p>

<p>
Presently he heard a man's footstep
in the library behind him, and the
subdued tinkling of a superior tea-service,
of which the sound differs from
the clatter of the hotel tea-tray, as the
voice, say, of Fanny Trehearne differed
in refinement from that of an Irish
cook.  But it irritated Lawrence,
nevertheless, and he did not look
round.  He felt that when Fanny
came down again, he intended to
refuse tea altogether&mdash;presumably, by
way of proving that he was not a spoilt
baby after all.  He crossed one leg
over the other impatiently, and hesitated
as to whether, if he lit a cigarette,
it would seem rude to be smoking when
Fanny should come, even though he
was really in the open air on the
verandah.  But in this, his manners had the
better of his impatience, and after
touching his cigarette case in his
pocket, in a longing way, he did not
take it out.
</p>

<p>
At last he heard Fanny enter the
room.  There was no mistaking her
tread, for he had noticed that she wore
tennis shoes.  He knew that she could
not see him where he sat, and he
turned his head towards the door
expectantly.  Again he heard the tinkle of
the tea-things.  Then there was silence.
Then the urn began to hiss and sing
softly, and there was another sort of
tinkling.  It was clear that Fanny had
sat down.  She could have no idea
that he was sitting outside, as he knew,
but he thought she might have taken
the trouble to look for him.  He
listened intently for the sound of her
step again, but it did not come, and,
oddly enough, his heart began to beat
more quickly.  But he did not move.
He felt a ridiculous determination to
wait until she began to be impatient
and to move about and look for him.
He could not have told whether it were
timidity, or nervousness, or ill-temper
which kept him nailed to his chair, and
just then he would have scorned the
idea that it could be love in any shape,
though his heart was beating so fast.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly his straining ear caught the
soft rustle made by the pages of a
book, turned deliberately and smoothed
afterwards.  She was calmly reading,
indifferent to his coming or staying
away&mdash;reading while the tea was
drawing.  How stolid she was, he thought.
She was certainly not conscious of the
action of her heart as she sat there.
For a few moments longer he did not
move.  Then he felt he wished to see
her, to see how she was sitting, and
how really indifferent she was.  But if
he made a sound, she would look up
and lay down her book even before he
entered the room.  The verandah had
a floor of painted boards,&mdash;which are
more noisy than unpainted ones, for
some occult reason,&mdash;and he could not
stir a step without being heard.  Besides,
his straw easy-chair would creak when
he rose.
</p>

<p>
All at once he felt how very foolish
he was, and he got up noisily, an angry
blush on his young face.  He reached
the entrance in two strides and stood
in the open doorway, with his back to
the light.  As he had guessed, Fanny
was reading.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" he ejaculated with affected
surprise, as he looked at her.
</p>

<p>
She did not raise her eyes nor start,
being evidently intent upon finishing
the sentence she had begun.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you were never coming,"
she said, absently.
</p>

<p>
He was more hurt than ever by her
indifference, and sat down at a little
distance, without moving the light chair
he had chosen.  Fanny reached the
foot of the page, put a letter she held
into the place, closed the book upon it,
and then at last looked up.
</p>

<p>
"Do you like your tea strong or
weak?" she enquired in a business-like tone.
</p>

<p>
"Just as it comes&mdash;I don't care,"
answered Lawrence, gloomily.
</p>

<p>
"Then I'll give it to you now.  I
like mine strong."
</p>

<p>
"It's bad for the nerves."
</p>

<p>
"I haven't any nerves," said Fanny
Trehearne, with conviction.
</p>

<p>
"That's curious," observed Lawrence,
with fine sarcasm.
</p>

<p>
Fanny looked at him without smiling,
since there was nothing to smile
at, and then poured out his tea.  He
took it in silence, but helped himself
to more sugar, with a reproachful air.
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;you like it sweet, do you?"
said Fanny, interrogatively.
</p>

<p>
"Peculiarity of spoilt babies,"
answered Lawrence, in bitter tones.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I see it is."
</p>

<p>
And with this crushing retort Fanny
Trehearne relapsed into silence.
Lawrence began to drink his tea, burnt his
mouth with courageous indifference,
stirred up the sugar gravely, and said
nothing.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder when they'll get home,"
said Fanny, after a long interval.
</p>

<p>
"Are you anxious about them?"
enquired the young man, with affected
politeness.
</p>

<p>
"Anxious?  No!  I was only wondering."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not very amusing, I know,"
said Lawrence, grimly.
</p>

<p>
"No, you're not."
</p>

<p>
The blood rushed to his face again
with his sudden irritation, and he drank
more hot tea to keep himself in
countenance.  At that moment he sincerely
wished that he had not come to Bar
Harbour at all.
</p>

<p>
"You're not particularly encouraging,
Miss Trehearne," he said presently.
"I'm sure, I'm doing my best
to be agreeable."
</p>

<p>
"And you think that I'm doing my
best to be disagreeable?  I'm not, you
know.  It's your imagination."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," answered Lawrence,
his face unbending a little.  "You
began by telling me that you despised me
because I'm such a duffer at out-of-door
things, then you told me I was a spoilt
baby, and now you're proving to me
that I'm a bore."
</p>

<p>
"Duffer, baby, and bore!" Fanny
laughed.  "What an appalling
combination!"
</p>

<p>
"It is, indeed.  But that's what you
said&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, nonsense!  I wasn't as rude
as that, was I?  But I never said
anything of the sort, you know."
</p>

<p>
"You really did say that I was a
spoilt baby&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I told you not to be, by way
of a general warning&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's the same thing&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Is it?  If I tell you not to go out
of the room, for instance, and if you
sit still&mdash;is it the same thing as though
you got up and went out?"
</p>

<p>
"Why no&mdash;of course not!  How
absurd!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, the other is absurd too."
</p>

<p>
"I'll never say again that women
aren't logical," answered Lawrence,
smiling in spite of himself.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;don't.  Have some more tea."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks&mdash;I've not finished.  It's
too hot to drink."
</p>

<p>
Thereupon, his good temper returning,
he desisted from self-torture by
scalding, and set the cup down.  Fanny
watched him, but turned her eyes away
as he looked up and she met his glance.
</p>

<p>
"I'm so glad you've come," she said
quietly.  "I've looked forward to it."
</p>

<p>
Perhaps she was a little the more
ready to say so, because she was
inwardly conscious of having rather
wilfully teased him, but she meant what
she said.  Lawrence felt his heart
beating again in a moment.  Resting his
elbow on his knees, he clasped his
hands and looked down at the pattern
of the rug under his feet.  She did not
realize how easily she could move him,
not being by any means a flirt.
</p>

<p>
"It's nothing to the way I've looked
forward to it," he answered.
</p>

<p>
She was silent, but he did not raise
his head.  He could see her face in
the carpet.
</p>

<p>
"You know that, don't you?" he
asked, in a low voice, after a few moments.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately for his information on
the subject, the butler appeared just
then, announcing a visitor.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Brinsley."
</p>

<p>
It was clear that the manservant
had no option in the matter of
admitting the newcomer, who was in the
room almost before his name was
pronounced.
</p>

<p>
"How do you do, Miss Trehearne?"
he began as he came swiftly forward.
"I'm tremendously glad to find you at
home.  You're generally out at this
hour."
</p>

<p>
"Is that why you chose it?" asked
Fanny, with a little laugh and holding
out her hand.  "Do you know
Mr. Lawrence?" she continued, by way of
introducing the two men.  "Mr. Brinsley,"
she added, for Louis's benefit.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence had risen, and he shook
hands with a good grace.  But he hated
Mr. Brinsley at once, both because the
latter had come inopportunely and
because his own sensitive nature was
instantly and strongly repelled by the
man.
</p>

<p>
There was no mistaking Mr. Brinsley's
Canadian accent, though he
seemed anxious to make it as English
as possible, and Lawrence disliked
Canadians; but that fact alone could
not have produced the strongly
disagreeable sensation of which the
younger man was at once conscious,
and he looked at the visitor in
something like surprise at the strength of
his instantaneous aversion.  Brinsley,
though dressed quietly, and with
irreproachable correctness, was a showy
man, of medium height, but magnificently
made.  His wrists were slender,
nervous, and sinewy, his ankles&mdash;displayed
to advantage by his low russet
shoes&mdash;were beautifully modelled,
whereas his shoulders were almost
abnormally broad, and the cords and
veins moved visibly in his athletic neck
when he spoke or moved.  The powerful
muscles were apparent under his
thin grey clothes, and Lawrence had
noticed the perfect grace and strength
of his quick step when he had entered.
In face he was very dark, and his wiry,
short black hair had rusty reflexions.
His skin was tanned to a deep brown,
and mottled, especially about the eyes,
with deep shadows, in which were
freckles even darker than the shadows
themselves.  His beard evidently grew
as high as his cheek bones, for the line
from which it was shaved was cleanly
drawn and marked by the dark fringe
remaining above.  His mustache was
black and heavy, and he wore very
small, closely cropped whiskers like
those affected by naval officers.  He
had one of those arrogant, vain, astute
noses which seem to point at whatever
the small and beady black eyes judge
to be worth having.
</p>

<p>
At a glance, Lawrence saw that
Brinsley was an athlete, and he guessed
instantly that the man must be good at
all those things which Louis himself
was unable to do.  He was a man to
ride, drive, run, pull an oar, and beat
everybody at tennis.  But neither was
that the reason why Lawrence hated
him from the first.  It had been the
touch of his hard dry hand, perhaps,
or the flash of the light in his small
black eyes, or his self-satisfied and
all-conquering expression.  It was not
easy to say.  Possibly, too, Louis
thought that Brinsley was his rival, and
resented the fact that Fanny had
betrayed no annoyance at the interruption.
</p>

<p>
But Brinsley barely vouchsafed
Lawrence a glance, as the latter thought,
and immediately sat himself down much
nearer to Miss Trehearne and the
tea-table than Louis, in his previous rage,
had thought fit to do.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Miss Trehearne," said Brinsley,
"how is Tim?  Isn't he all right
yet?"
</p>

<p>
"He's better," answered Fanny.
"He had a bad time of it, but you
can't kill a wire-haired terrier, you
know.  He wouldn't take the
phosphate.  I believe it was sweetened, and
he hates sugar."
</p>

<p>
"So do I.  Please don't give me
any," he added quickly, watching her
as she prepared a cup of tea for him.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence's resentment began to grow
again.  It was doubtless because
Mr. Brinsley never took sugar that Fanny
had seemed scornfully surprised at the
artist's weakness for it.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
</h3>

<p>
Louis Lawrence was exceedingly
uncomfortable during the next few
minutes, and to add to his misery, he was
quite conscious that he had nothing to
complain of.  It was natural that he
should not know the people in Bar
Harbour, excepting those whom he had
known before, and that he should be
in complete ignorance of all projected
gaieties.  Of course no one had
suggested to the Reveres, for instance, to
ask him to their dance; because they
were Boston people, they did not know
him, and nobody was aware that he
was within reach.  Besides, Louis
Lawrence was a very insignificant
personage, though he was well-connected,
well-bred, and not ill-looking.  He was
just now a mere struggling artist, with
no money except in the questionable
future, and if he had talent, it was
problematical, since he had not distinguished
himself in any way as yet.
</p>

<p>
He remembered all these things, but
they did not console him.  In order
not to seem rude, he made vague
remarks from time to time, when
something occurred to him to say, but he
inwardly wished Brinsley a speedy
departure and a fearful end.  Fanny
seemed amused and interested by the
man's conversation, and she herself
talked fluently.  Now and then Brinsley
looked at Lawrence, really surprised
by the latter's ignorance of everything
in the nature of sport, and possibly
with a passing contempt which Lawrence
noticed and proceeded to exaggerate
in importance.  The artist was
on the point of asking Fanny's permission
to go and find the room allotted
to him, when a sound of women's
voices, high and low, came through the
open windows.  There was an audible
little confusion in the hall, and the
three Miss Miners entered the library
one after the other in quick succession.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Brinsley!" exclaimed Miss
Cordelia, the eldest, coming forward
with a pale smile which showed many
of her very beautiful teeth.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Brinsley is here," said Miss
Elizabeth, the ugly one, in an
undertone to Miss Augusta, who possessed
the accomplishments.
</p>

<p>
Then they also advanced and shook
hands with much cordiality, the remains
of which were promptly offered to
Lawrence.  Mr. Brinsley did not seem in
the least overpowered by the sudden
entrance of the three old maids.  He
smiled, moved up several chairs to the
tea-table, and laughed agreeably over
each chair, though Lawrence could not
see that there was anything to laugh at.
Brinsley's vitality was tremendous, and
his manners were certainly very good,
so that he was a useful person in a
drawing-room.  His assurance, if put
to the test, would have been found
equal to most emergencies.  But on
the present occasion he had no need
of it.  It was evidently his mission to
be worshipped by the three Miss Miners
and to be liked by Miss Trehearne,
who did not like everybody.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure we've missed the best
part of your visit," said Miss Cordelia.
</p>

<p>
"Oh no," answered Brinsley, promptly.
"I've only just come&mdash;at least it
seems so to me," he added, smiling at
Fanny across the tea-table.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence thought he must have been
in the room more than half an hour,
but the sisters were all delighted by
the news that their idol meant to stay
some time longer.
</p>

<p>
"How nice it would be if everybody
made such speeches!" sighed Miss
Augusta to Lawrence, who was next to
her.  "Such a charming way of making
Fanny feel that she talks well!
I'm sure he's really been here some
time."
</p>

<p>
"He has," answered Lawrence, absently
and without lowering his voice
enough, for Brinsley immediately
glanced at him.
</p>

<p>
"We've been having such a pleasant
talk about the dogs and horses," said
the Canadian, willing to be disagreeable
to the one other man present.
"I'm afraid we've bored Mr. Lawrence
to death, Miss Trehearne&mdash;he doesn't
seem to care for those things as much
as we do."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know anything about them,"
answered the young man.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid you'll bore yourself in Bar
Harbour, then," observed Mr. Brinsley.
"What can you find to do all day
long?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing.  I'm an artist."
</p>

<p>
"Ah?  That's very nice&mdash;you'll be
able to go out sketching with Miss
Augusta&mdash;long excursions, don't you
know?  All day&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I shouldn't dare to suggest
such a thing!" cried Miss Augusta.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure I should be very happy,
if you'd like to go," said Lawrence,
politely facing the dreadful possibility
of a day with her in the woods, while
Brinsley would in all likelihood be
riding with Fanny or taking her out
in a catboat.
</p>

<p>
But Miss Augusta paid little attention
to him, so long as Brinsley was
talking, which was most of the time.
The man did not say anything worth
repeating, but Lawrence knew that he
was far from stupid in spite of his
empty talk.  At last Lawrence merely
looked on, controlling his nervousness
as well as he could and idly watching
the faces of the party.  Brinsley talked
on and on, twisting to pieces the stem
of a flower which he had worn in his
coat, but which had unaccountably
broken off.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence wondered whether Fanny,
too, could be under the charm, and he
watched her with some anxiety.  There
was something oddly inscrutable in the
young girl's face and in her quiet eyes
that did not often smile, even when
she laughed.  He had the strong
impression, and he had felt it before, that
she was very well able to conceal her
real thoughts and intentions, behind a
mask of genuine frankness and
straightforwardness.  There are certain men
and women who possess that gift.
Without ever saying a word which
even faintly suggests prevarication, they
have a masterly reticence about what
they do not wish to have known,
whereby their acquaintances are
sometimes more completely deceived than
they could be by the most ingenious
falsehood.  Lawrence was quite unable
to judge from Fanny's face whether
she liked Brinsley or not, but he was
wounded by a certain deference, if
that word be not too strong, which she
showed for the man's opinion, and
which contrasted slightly with the
dictatorial superiority which she assumed
towards Lawrence himself.  He
consoled himself as well as he could with
the reflection that he really knew
nothing about dogs, horses, or boats, and
that Brinsley was certainly his master
in all such knowledge.
</p>

<p>
As an artist, he could not but admire
the perfect proportions of the visitor,
the strength of him, and the satisfactory
equilibrium of forces which showed
itself in his whole physical being; but as
a gentleman he was repelled by something
not easily defined, and as a lover
he suspected a rival.  He had not much
right, indeed, to believe that Fanny
Trehearne cared especially for him, any
more than to predicate that she was in
love with Brinsley.  But, being in love
himself, he very naturally arrogated to
himself such a right without the slightest
hesitation, and he boldly asserted in
his heart that Brinsley was nothing but
a very handsome 'cad,' and that Fanny
Trehearne was on the verge of marrying
him.
</p>

<p>
The conversation, meanwhile, was
lively to the ear, if not to the
intelligence.  It was amazing to see how the
three spinsters flattered their darling
at every turn.  Miss Cordelia led the
chorus of praise, and her sisters, to
speak musically, took up the theme,
and answer, and counter-theme of the
fugue, successively, in many keys.
There was nothing that Mr. Brinsley
did not know and could not do,
according to the three Miss Miners, or if
there were anything, it could not be
worth knowing or doing.
</p>

<p>
"You'll flatter Mr. Brinsley to death,"
laughed Fanny, "though I must say that
he bears it well."
</p>

<p>
A faint shade of colour rose in Miss
Cordelia's pale cheeks, indicative of
indignation.
</p>

<p>
"Fanny!" she cried reprovingly.
"How rude you are!  I'm sure I
wasn't saying anything at all flattering."
</p>

<p>
"I only wish people would say such
things to me, then!" retorted the young
girl.
</p>

<p>
"We're all quite ready to, I'm sure,
Miss Trehearne," said Brinsley, smiling
in a way that seemed to make his heavy
dark mustache retreat outward, up his
cheeks, like the whiskers of a cat when
it grins.
</p>

<p>
Fanny looked round and met Lawrence's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You seem to be the only one who
is ready," she said, laughing again.
"One isn't a crowd, as the little boys
say."
</p>

<p>
"Where do you get such expressions,
my dear child?" asked Cordelia.  "I
really think you've learned more slang
since you've been here this summer,
though I shouldn't have believed it
possible!"
</p>

<p>
"There!" exclaimed Fanny, turning
to Mr. Brinsley again.  "That's the kind
of flattery my relatives lavish on me
from morning till night!  As if you
didn't all talk slang, the whole time!"
</p>

<p>
"Fanny!" protested Augusta, whose
accomplishments made her sensitive and
conscious.  "How can you say so?"
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;dialect, if you like the word
better.  I'll prove it you.  You all
say 'won't' and 'shan't'&mdash;and most
of you say 'I'd like'&mdash;for instance&mdash;and
Mr. Brinsley says 'ain't,' because
he's English&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;what ought we to say?"
asked Augusta.  "Nobody says 'I will
not,' and all that."
</p>

<p>
"You ought to.  It's dialect not
to&mdash;and the absurd thing is that
people who go in for writing books
generally write out all the things you
don't say, and write them in the wrong
order.  We say 'wouldn't you'&mdash;don't
we?  Well, doesn't that stand for 'would
not you'?  And yet they print 'would
you not'&mdash;always.  It's ridiculous.  I
read a criticism the other day on a man
who had written a book and who wrote
'will not you' for 'won't you' and
'would not you' for 'wouldn't you'
because he wanted to be accurate.
You've no idea what horrid things the
critic said of him&mdash;he simply stood
on his hind legs and pawed the air!
It's so silly!  Either we should speak
as we write, or write as we speak.  I
don't mean in philosophy&mdash;and
things&mdash;the steam-engine and the descent of
man, and all that&mdash;but in writing out
conversations.  But then, of course,
nobody will agree with me&mdash;so I talk
as I please."
</p>

<p>
"There's a great deal of truth in
what you say, Miss Trehearne,"
observed Brinsley, assuming a wise air.
"Besides, I beg to differ from Miss
Miner, on one point&mdash;I venture to
say that I don't dislike your slang, if
it's slang at all.  It's expressive, of its
kind."
</p>

<p>
"At last!" cried Fanny, with a
laugh.  "I get some praise&mdash;faint,
but perceptible."
</p>

<p>
"Faint praise isn't supposed to be
complimentary," observed Lawrence,
laughing too.
</p>

<p>
"That's true," answered Fanny.
"It's just the opposite&mdash;the thing
with a d&mdash;  I won't say it on account
of Cordelia.  She'd all frizzle up with
horror if I said it&mdash;wouldn't you,
dear?  There'd positively be nothing
left of you&mdash;nothing but a dear little
withered rose-leaf with a dewdrop in
the middle, representing your tears for
my sins!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid so," answered Cordelia,
with a little accentuation of her tired
smile.
</p>

<p>
It was not a disagreeable smile in
itself, except that it was perpetual and
was the expression of patiently and
cheerfully borne adversity, rather than
of any satisfaction with things in
general.  For the lives of the three
Miss Miners had not been happy.
Sometimes Fanny felt a sincere and
loving pity for the three, and especially
for the eldest.  But there were also
times when Cordelia's smile exasperated
her beyond endurance.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Brinsley rose to go, rather
suddenly, after checking a movement of
his hand in the direction of his watch.
"You're not going, surely!" cried
one or two of the Miss Miners.  "You're
coming to dinner."
</p>

<p>
"Stay as you are," suggested Fanny,
greatly to Lawrence's annoyance.
</p>

<p>
"You're awfully kind," answered the
Canadian.  "But I can't, to-night.  I
wish I could.  I've asked several people
to dine with me at the Kebo Valley
Club.  I'd cut any other engagement,
to dine with you&mdash;indeed I would.
I'm awfully sorry."
</p>

<p>
Many regrets were expressed that he
could not stay, and the leave-taking
seemed sudden to Lawrence, who stood
looking on, still wondering why he
disliked the man so much.  At last he
heard the front door closed behind
him.
</p>

<p>
"Who is Mr. Brinsley?" he asked
of Fanny Trehearne, while the three
Miss Miners were settling themselves
again.
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;I don't know.  I believe he's
a Canadian Englishman.  He's very
agreeable&mdash;don't you think so?"
</p>

<p>
"He's the most delightful man I
ever met!" sighed Augusta Miner,
before Lawrence had time to say anything.
</p>

<p>
"Did you notice his eyes, Mr. Lawrence?"
asked Miss Elizabeth.  "Don't
you think they're beautiful?"
</p>

<p>
"Beautiful?  Well&mdash;it depends,"
Lawrence answered with considerable
hesitation, for he did not in the least
know what to say.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but it isn't his eyes, nor his
conversation!" put in Cordelia,
emphatically.  "It is that he's such a
perfect gentleman!  You feel that he
wouldn't do anything that wasn't
quite&mdash;quite&mdash;don't you know?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not sure that I do," replied
Lawrence, in some bewilderment.  "But
I understand what you mean," he added
confidently.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," said Augusta to her
eldest sister, "all that is perfectly true,
as I always say.  But those are not the
things that make him the most
charming man I ever met.  Oh dear, no!
Ever so many men one knows have
good eyes, and talk well, and are
gentlemen in every way.  I'm sure you
wouldn't have a man about if he wasn't
a gentleman.  Would you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh no&mdash;in a wider sense&mdash;all
the men we have to do with are, of
course&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well," argued Augusta, "that's just
what I'm telling you, my dear.  It isn't
those things.  It lies much deeper.
It's a sort of refined appreciation&mdash;an
appreciative refinement&mdash;both, you
know.  Now, the other day, do you
remember?&mdash;when I was playing that
Mazurka of Chopin&mdash;did you notice
his expression?"
</p>

<p>
"But he always has that expression
when anything pleases him very much,"
said Miss Elizabeth.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know.  But just then, it was
quite extraordinary&mdash;there's something
almost childlike&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If you go on about Mr. Brinsley in
this way much longer, you'll all have a
fit," observed Fanny Trehearne.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," answered Cordelia,
gravely, "do you know what a 'fit'
means?  Really, sometimes, you do
exaggerate&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A fit means convulsions&mdash;what
babies have, you know.  They used to
say it was brought on by looking at
the moon."
</p>

<p>
Lawrence felt a strong inclination to
laugh at this moment, but he controlled
it, and only smiled.  Then, to his
considerable embarrassment, they all
appealed to him, probably in the hope of
more praise for Brinsley.
</p>

<p>
"Do tell us how he strikes you,
Mr. Lawrence," said Cordelia.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, do!" echoed Elizabeth.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, please do!" cried Augusta, at
the same moment.
</p>

<p>
"I should be curious to know what
you think of him," said Fanny Trehearne.
</p>

<p>
"Well, really," stammered the
unfortunate young man, "I've hardly
seen him&mdash;I've not had time to form
an opinion&mdash;you must know him, and
you all like him, and&mdash;it seems to
me&mdash;that settles it.  Doesn't it?"
</p>

<p>
While Lawrence was speaking, Miss
Cordelia stooped and picked something
up from the floor.  He noticed
that it was the leafless stem of the
flower which Brinsley had been twisting
in his fingers.  She did not throw
it away, but her hand closed over it,
and Lawrence did not see it again.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
</h3>

<p>
Louis Lawrence had not been at
Bar Harbour a week before he became
fully aware&mdash;if indeed there had
previously been any doubt on the subject
in his mind&mdash;that he was very much
in love with Fanny Trehearne.  It
became clear to him that, although he had
believed himself to be in love once or
twice before then, he had been
mistaken, and that he had never known
until the present time exactly what love
meant.  He was not even sure that he
was pleased with the passion, or, at
least, with the form in which it attacked
him.  Sensitive as he was, it 'took him
hard,' as the saying is, and he felt that
it had the better of him at every turn,
and disposed of him in spite of himself
at every hour of the day.
</p>

<p>
When he was alone he wondered
why he had been asked to the house,
and whether Mr. and Mrs. Trehearne,
who were abroad, knew anything about
it.  He was a modest man, and was
inclined to underestimate himself, so
that it could never have occurred to
him that Fanny Trehearne might have
been strongly attracted by him during
their acquaintance in town, and might
have insisted that he should be asked
to come and pass a fortnight.
Moreover, Fanny lost no opportunity of
impressing upon him that he was a
great favourite with the three Miss
Miners, and she managed to convey
the impression that he had been asked
chiefly to please them, though she
never said so.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, however, it was evident
that the three sisters were absorbed in
Mr. Brinsley, and that when the latter
was present they took very little notice
of Lawrence.  He laughed at the
thought that the three old maids
should all be equally in love with the
showy Canadian, and he told himself
that the thing was ridiculous; that they
were merely enthusiastic women,&mdash;'gushing'
women, he called them in
his thoughts,&mdash;who were flattered by
the diplomatic and unfailing civilities
of a man who was evidently in pursuit
of Fanny Trehearne.
</p>

<p>
For by this time he was convinced
that Brinsley had made up his mind to
marry Fanny if he could; and he hated
him all the more for it, even to
formulating wicked prayers for the suitor's
immediate destruction.  The worst of
it was, that the man might possibly
succeed.  A girl who will and can ride
anything, who beats everybody at
tennis, and who is as good as most men
in a sail-boat, may naturally be supposed
to admire a man who does those things,
and many others, in a style bordering
upon perfection.  This same man, too,
though not exactly clever in an
intellectual way, possessed at least the gifts
of fluency and tact, combined with
great coolness under all circumstances,
so far as Lawrence had observed him.
It was hardly fair to assert that he was
dishonest because he flattered the three
Miss Miners, and occupied himself
largely in trying to anticipate their
smallest wishes.  He did it so well as
to make even Fanny Trehearne believe
that he liked them for their own sakes,
and that his intentions were disinterested
and not directed wholly to herself.
Of course she knew that he
wished to marry her; but she was used
to that.  Two, at least, of several men
who had already informed her that
their happiness depended upon winning
her, were even now in Bar Harbour,&mdash;presumably
repeating that or a similar
statement to more or less willing ears.
As for Lawrence, he could not fairly
blame Brinsley for his behaviour&mdash;he
confessed in secret that he flattered the
three Miss Miners himself, with small
regard for unprejudiced truth.  Besides,
they were very kind to him.  But he
found it hard to speak fairly of Brinsley
when alone with Fanny Trehearne.
</p>

<p>
"I don't like the man," he said, on
inadequate provocation, for the
twentieth time.
</p>

<p>
"I know you don't," answered
Fanny, calmly, "but that's no reason for
letting go of the tiller.  Mind the
boom! she's going about&mdash;no&mdash;it's of no use
to put the helm up now.  We've no way
on&mdash;let her go!  No&mdash;I don't mean
that&mdash;oh, do give it to me!"
</p>

<p>
And thereupon Fanny, who was sitting
forward of him on the weather side,
stretched her long arm across him,
pushing him back into his corner, and
put the helm hard down with her left
hand, while she hauled in the sheet as
much as she could with her right,
bending her head low to avoid the boom as
it came swinging over.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence could not help looking
down at her, and he forgot all about
the boom, being far too little familiar
with boating to avoid it instinctively,
when he felt the boat going about.  It
came slowly, for there was little wind;
and the catboat, having no way on to
speak of, was in no hurry to right
herself and go over on the other tack,&mdash;but
just as the shadow of the sail warned
him that something was coming, he
looked up, and at the same instant
received the blow full on his forehead,
just above his eyes.  He wore a soft,
knitted woollen cap, which did not even
afford the protection of a visor.
</p>

<p>
Fanny turned her head at once, for
the blow had been audible, and she
saw what had happened.  Lawrence
had raised his hand to his forehead
instinctively.
</p>

<p>
"Are you hurt?" asked Fanny,
quickly, keeping her eyes upon him,
and still holding the helm hard over
so as to give the boat way.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence did not answer at once.
He was half stunned, and still covered
his forehead with his hand.  The young
girl looked at him intently, and there
was an expression in her eyes which
he, at least, had never seen there&mdash;a
sudden, scared light which had nothing
to do with fear.
</p>

<p>
"Are you hurt?" she asked again,
gently.
</p>

<p>
His delicate face grew suddenly pale,
as the blood, which had rushed up at
first under the shock of the blow,
subsided as suddenly.  Fanny turned her
eyes from him and looked ahead and
under the sail to leeward.  She let out
a little more sheet, so that the boat
could run very free; for the craft, like
most catboats, had a weather helm
when the sheet was well aft, and Fanny
wanted her hands.  Moreover,
Lawrence was now on the lee side with
her, and the boat would have heeled
too far over with the wind abeam.
As soon as the sail drew properly,
Fanny sat up beside Lawrence, steering
across him with her left hand.  With
her right she could reach the water,
and she scooped up what she could in
her hollow palm, wetting her sleeve to
the shoulder as she did so, for the boat
was gaining speed.  She dashed the
drops in his face.
</p>

<p>
"Are you hurt?" she asked a third
time, drawing away his hand and laying
her own wet one upon his forehead.
</p>

<p>
"Oh no," he answered faintly.  "I'm
not hurt at all."
</p>

<p>
She could tell by his voice that he
was not speaking the truth, and a
moment later, as he leaned against the
side of the boat, his head fell back, and
his lips parted in a dead faint.
</p>

<p>
There was no scorn in the young
girl's face for a man who could faint
so easily, as it seemed; but the scared
look came into her eyes again, and
without hesitation, still steering with
her left hand, she passed her right arm
round his neck and supported him.
The breeze was almost in her face
now, for she was looking astern, and
she knew by the way it fanned her
whether she was keeping the boat fairly
before it.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence did not revive immediately,
and it was fortunate that there
was so little wind, or Fanny might have
got into trouble.  She looked at him a
moment longer and hesitated, for the
position was a difficult one, as will be
admitted.  But she was equal to it
and knew what to do.  Letting his
head fall back as it would, she
withdrew her arm, let go the helm, and
hauled in the sheet as the boat's head
came up.  As the boom came over
towards Lawrence's head, she caught
it and lifted it over him, hauled in the
slack and made the sheet fast, springing
forward instantly to let go the
halliards.  The gaff came rattling down,
and she gathered in the bellying sail
hastily and took a turn round
everything with the end of the throat
halliard, which chanced to be long
enough&mdash;the gaskets were out of her reach,
in the bottom of the boat.
</p>

<p>
There was little or no sea on, as the
tide was near the turning, and the
cat-boat was rocking softly to the little
waves when Fanny came aft again.
Lawrence's head was still hanging back,
his lips were parted, and his eyes were
half open, showing the whites in a rather
ghastly way.  With strong arms the
young girl half lifted him, and let him
gently down upon the cushions in the
stern-sheets.  Then she leaned over
the side and wetted her handkerchief
and laid it upon his bruised forehead.
The cold water and the change of
position brought him to himself.
</p>

<p>
He opened his eyes and looked up
into her face as she bent over him.
Then, all at once, he seemed to realize
what had happened, and with an
exclamation he tried to sit up.  But she
would not let him.
</p>

<p>
"Lie still a minute longer!" she
said authoritatively.  "You'll be all
right in a little while."
</p>

<p>
"But it isn't anything, I assure you,"
he protested, looking about him in a
dazed way.  "Please let me sit up!
I won't make a fool of myself again&mdash;it's
only my heart, you know.  It stops
sometimes&mdash;it wasn't the knock."
</p>

<p>
"Your heart?" repeated Fanny, with
greater anxiety than Lawrence might
have expected.  "You haven't got heart
disease, have you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh no&mdash;not so bad as that.  It's
all right now.  It will begin to beat very
hard presently&mdash;there&mdash;I can feel it&mdash;and
then it will go on regularly again.
It isn't anything.  I fancy I smoke too
much&mdash;or it's coffee&mdash;or something.
Please don't look as though you thought
it were anything serious, Miss Trehearne.
I assure you, it's nothing.  Lots of
people have it."
</p>

<p>
"It is serious.  Anything that has to
do with the heart is serious."
</p>

<p>
Lawrence smiled faintly.
</p>

<p>
"Is that a joke?" he asked.  "If it
is, please let me sit up."
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;that isn't a reason," answered
Fanny, laughing a little, though her
eyes were still grave.  "You must lie
still a little longer.  You might faint
again, you know.  It must be dangerous
to have one's heart behaving so strangely."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;I don't believe so."
</p>

<p>
"You don't believe so?  You mean
that it's possible, but that you hope it
won't stop?  Is that it?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;well&mdash;perhaps.  But I don't
think there's any real danger.  Besides&mdash;if
it did, it's easy, you know."
</p>

<p>
"What's easy?"
</p>

<p>
"It's an easy death&mdash;over at once,
in a flash.  No lingering and last words
and all that."  He laughed.
</p>

<p>
Fanny Trehearne's sunburned cheeks
grew pale under their tan, and her
cool grey eyes turned slowly away
from his face, and rested on the blue water.
</p>

<p>
"Please don't talk about such things!"
she said in a tone that seemed hard to
Lawrence.
</p>

<p>
"Are you afraid of death?" he asked,
still smiling.
</p>

<p>
"I?"  She turned upon him indignantly.
"No&mdash;I don't believe that I'm
much afraid of anything&mdash;for myself."
</p>

<p>
"You turned pale," observed the
young man, raising himself on his
elbow as he lay on the cushions, and
looking at her.  Her colour came back
more quickly than it had gone.
</p>

<p>
"Did I?" she asked indifferently
enough.  "It's probably the sun.  It's
hot, lying here and drifting."
</p>

<p>
"No.  It wasn't the sun," said
Lawrence, with conviction.  "You were
thinking that somebody you are fond
of might die suddenly.  We were
talking about death."
</p>

<p>
"What difference does it make whom
I was thinking of?"  She spoke
impatiently now, still watching the water.
</p>

<p>
"It makes all the difference there is,
that's all," answered Lawrence.  "Won't
you tell me?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Certainly not!  Why should
I?  Look here&mdash;if you're well enough
to talk, you're well enough to help me
to get the sail up again."
</p>

<p>
"Of course I am&mdash;but&mdash;"  Lawrence
showed no inclination to move.
</p>

<p>
"But what?  You're too lazy, I
suppose."  Fanny laughed.  "Let me see
your forehead&mdash;take your cap off,"
she added with a change of tone.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence thrust the cap back, which
did not help matters much, as his hair
grew low and partially hid the bruise.
The skin was not broken, but it was
almost purple, and a large swelling had
already appeared.
</p>

<p>
"It's too bad!" exclaimed Fanny,
looking at it, as he bent down his head,
and softly touching it with her
ungloved hand.  "Tell me&mdash;do you feel
very weak and dizzy still?  I was only
laughing when I spoke of your helping
me with the sail."
</p>

<p>
"Oh no!" answered Lawrence,
cheerfully.  "It aches a little, of course,
but it will soon go off."
</p>

<p>
"And your heart?" asked Fanny,
anxiously.  "Is it all right now?  You
don't think you'll faint again, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not sure.  You're very pale."
</p>

<p>
"I'm always pale, you know.  It's
my nature.  It doesn't mean anything.
Some people are naturally pale."
</p>

<p>
"But you're not.  You're dark, or
brown, and not red, but you're not
usually pale.  I wish I had some
whiskey, or something, to give you."
</p>

<p>
She looked round the boat rather
helplessly as though expecting to
discover a remedy for his weakness.
</p>

<p>
"Please don't make so much of it,"
said Lawrence, in a tone which showed
that he was almost annoyed by her
persistence.  "I assure you that I
won't have such bad taste as to die on
your hands before we get to land!"
</p>

<p>
Fanny rose to her feet and turned
away from him with an impatient
exclamation.
</p>

<p>
"Just keep the helm amidships
while I get the sail up," she said,
without looking at him, and stepping upon
the seat which ran along the side, she
was on the little deck in a moment,
with both halliards in her hands.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence sprang forward to help her,
forgetting what she had just told him
to do.
</p>

<p>
"Do as I told you!" she exclaimed
quickly and impatiently.  "Do you
know what the tiller is?  Well, keep
it right in the middle till I tell you to
do something else."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be fierce about it," laughed
Lawrence, obeying her.
</p>

<p>
But when she was not looking, he
pressed one hand to his forehead with
all his might, as though to drive out
the pain, which increased with every
minute.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Fanny laid her weight to
the halliards, and the sail went
flapping up, throat and peak.  The girl
was very strong, and had been taught
to handle a catboat when she had
been a mere child, so that there was
nothing extraordinary in her
accomplishing unaided a little feat which
would have puzzled many a smart
young gentleman who fancies
himself half a sailor.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
</h3>

<p>
It chanced that on that evening
Roger Brinsley was to dine with the
Miss Miners.  He was often asked, and
he accepted as often as he could.  As
a matter of fact, he was not so much
sought after elsewhere, as he was
willing to let the four ladies believe, for
there were people in Bar Harbour who
shared Lawrence's distrust of him, while
admitting that, so far as they could tell,
it was quite unfounded.  There was
nothing against him.  The men said
that he played a good deal at the club,
and remarked that he was a good type
of the professional gambler, but no one
ever said that he won too much.  On
the contrary, it was believed that he had
lost altogether rather heavily during the
six weeks since he had first appeared.
He paid cheerfully, however, and was
thought to be rich.  Nevertheless, the
men whose opinion was worth having
did not like him.  They wondered why
the Miss Miners had him so often to
the house, and whether there were not
some danger that Fanny Trehearne
might take a fancy to him.
</p>

<p>
It was very late when Fanny and
Lawrence got home, for the catboat
had been carried far up Frenchman's
Bay during the time after the little
accident, and it had been necessary to beat
to windward for two hours against the
rising tide in order to fetch the channel
between Bar Island and Sheep
Porcupine.  The consequence was that the
pair had scarcely time to dress for
dinner after they reached the house.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence felt ill and tired, and was
conscious that the swelling on his
forehead was not beautiful to see.  He was
still dazed, and by no means himself,
when he looked into the glass and
knotted his tie.  But though he might
well have given an excuse and stayed
in his room instead of going down to
dinner, he refused to consider the
possibility of such a thing even for a
moment.  He felt something just then
which more than compensated him for
his bruises and his wretched sensation
of weakness.
</p>

<p>
The conversation, after the boat had
got under way again, had languished,
and had been so constantly interrupted
by the often repeated operation of
going about, that Lawrence had not
succeeded in bringing it back to the
point at which Fanny had broken it off
when she had gone forward to hoist
the sail.  But he had more than half
guessed what might have followed, and
the reasonable belief that he might be
right had changed the face of his
world.  He believed that Fanny had
turned pale at the idea that his life
was in danger.
</p>

<p>
One smiles at the simplicity of the
thought, in black and white, by itself,
just itself, and nothing more.  Yet it
was a great matter to Louis Lawrence,
and as he looked at his bruised face in
the glass he felt that he was too happy
to shut himself up in his room for the
evening, out of sight of the cool grey
eyes he loved.
</p>

<p>
He had assuredly not meant to
frighten Fanny when he had spoken,
and he had been very far from inventing
an imaginary ailment with which to
excite her sympathy.  The whole thing
had come up unexpectedly as the result
of the accident.  Hence its value.
</p>

<p>
As often happens, the two people in
the house who had been most hurried
in dressing were the first down, and as
Lawrence entered the library he heard
Fanny's footstep behind him.  He
bowed as they came forward together
to the empty fireplace.  She looked at
him critically before she spoke.
</p>

<p>
"You're badly knocked about.  How
do you feel?"  There was a man-like
directness in her way of asking questions,
which was softened by the beauty
of her voice.
</p>

<p>
"I feel&mdash;as I never felt before,"
answered Lawrence, conscious that
his eyes grew dark as they met hers.
"You told me something to-day&mdash;though
you did not say it."
</p>

<p>
Fanny did not avoid his gaze.
</p>

<p>
"Did I?" she asked very gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Plainly."
</p>

<p>
"I'm very sorry," she answered, with a
little sigh, and turning from him at last.
</p>

<p>
"Are you taking it back?"  Louis's
voice trembled as he asked the question.
</p>

<p>
"Hush!"
</p>

<p>
Just then the voices of the three
Miss Miners were heard in the hall,
and at the same instant the distant
tinkle of the front-door bell announced
the arrival of Roger Brinsley.
</p>

<p>
The conversation turned upon Lawrence's
accident, from the first, as was
natural, considering his appearance.
He dwelt laughingly on his utter
helplessness in a boat, while Fanny was
inclined to consider the whole affair as
rather serious.  For some reason or
other Brinsley was displeased at it, and
ventured to say a disagreeable thing.
He had lost at cards in the afternoon
and was in bad humour.  He spoke to
Fanny with affected apprehension.
</p>

<p>
"You really ought to take somebody
with you who knows enough to lend a
hand at a pinch, Miss Trehearne," he
said.  "Suppose that you got into a
squall and had to take a reef&mdash;you'd
be in a bad way, you know."
</p>

<p>
"If I couldn't manage a catboat
alone, I'd walk," answered Fanny, with
contempt.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;no doubt.  But if a squall
really came up, what would you do?
Mr. Lawrence confesses that he couldn't
help you."
</p>

<p>
"Are you chaffing, Mr. Brinsley?"
asked Fanny, severely.  "Or do you
think I really shouldn't know what to
do?"
</p>

<p>
"I doubt whether you would."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;I'd let go the halliards and
lash the helm amidships, and take my
reef with the sail down&mdash;'hoist 'em up
and off again,' after that, as the
fishermen say."
</p>

<p>
"I think you could stand an examination,"
said Brinsley.
</p>

<p>
"I daresay.  Could you?  If you
were going about off a lee shore in a
storm and missed stays, could you
club-haul your ship, Mr. Brinsley?"
</p>

<p>
The three Miss Miners stared at the
two in surprise and wonder, not
understanding a word of what they were
saying.  It was apparent to Lawrence,
however, that Fanny was bent on putting
Brinsley in the position of confessing
his ignorance at last; but where the
young girl had learned even the
language of seamanship, which she used
with such apparent precision, was more
than Lawrence could guess.  Brinsley
did not answer at once, and Fanny
pressed him.
</p>

<p>
"Do you even know what club-hauling
means?" she asked, mercilessly.
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;no&mdash;really, I think the
term must be obsolete."
</p>

<p>
"Not at sea," retorted Fanny.
</p>

<p>
This was crushing, and Brinsley, who
was really a very good hand at ordinary
sailing, grew angry.
</p>

<p>
"Of course you've had some experience
in catboats," Fanny continued.
"That isn't serious sailing, you know.
It's about equivalent, in horsemanship,
to riding a donkey&mdash;a degree less
dignified than walking, and a little less
trouble."
</p>

<p>
"I won't say anything about myself,
Miss Trehearne," said Brinsley, "but
you might treat the catboat a little less
roughly.  I didn't know you'd ever
sailed anything else."
</p>

<p>
Here the Miss Miners interposed,
one after the other, protesting that it
was not fair to use up the opportunities
of conversation in such nautical
jargon.
</p>

<p>
"I only wished to prove to Mr. Brinsley
that I'm to be trusted at sea,"
Fanny answered.
</p>

<p>
"My dear child," said Miss Cordelia,
"Mr. Brinsley knows that, and he must
be a good judge, having been in the
navy."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I didn't know you'd been in
the navy, Mr. Brinsley," said the
pitiless young girl, fixing her eyes on his
with an expression which he, perhaps,
understood, though no one else noticed
it.  "The English navy, of course?"
</p>

<p>
"The English navy," repeated Mr. Brinsley,
sharply.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well&mdash;that accounts for your
not knowing how to club-haul a ship.
Your own people are always saying that
your service is going to the dogs."
</p>

<p>
Even Lawrence was surprised, and
Brinsley looked angrily across the table
at his tormentor, but found nothing to
say on the spur of the moment.
</p>

<p>
"However," Fanny continued with
some condescension, "I'm rather glad
to know you're a navy man.  I'll get
you to come out with me some day
and verify some of the bearings on our
local chart.  I believe there are one or
two mistakes.  We'll take the sextant
and my chronometer with us, and the
tables, and take the sun&mdash;each of us,
you know, and work it out separately,
and see how near we get.  That will
be great fun.  You must all come and
see Mr. Brinsley and me take the sun,"
she added, looking round at the others.
"Let's go to-morrow.  We'll take our
luncheon with us and picnic on board.
Can you come to-morrow, Mr. Brinsley?
We must start at eleven so as to get
far enough out to have a horizon by
noon.  I hope you're not engaged?
Are you?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry to say I am," answered
the unfortunate man.  "I'm going to
ride with some people just at that
hour."
</p>

<p>
"How unlucky!" exclaimed Fanny,
who had expected the refusal.  "I'll
take Mr. Lawrence, anyhow, and give
him a lesson in navigation."
</p>

<p>
"I've had one to-day," said Lawrence,
affecting to laugh, for it was his
instinct to try and turn off any
conversation from a disagreeable subject.
</p>

<p>
"You'll be all the better for another
to-morrow," answered Fanny.
</p>

<p>
As she spoke to the artist, her tone
changed so perceptibly that even the
Miss Miners noticed it.  Brinsley took
the first opportunity of talking to Miss
Cordelia, of whose admiration he was
sure, and the rest of the dinner passed
off in peace, Brinsley avoiding a
renewal of hostilities with something
almost like fear, for he felt that the
extraordinary young girl who knew so
much about navigation was watching
for another opportunity of humiliating
him, and would not be merciful in
using it.
</p>

<p>
The change in her manner to him
had been very sudden, as though she
had on that particular day made up her
mind about something concerning him.
Hitherto she had treated him almost
cordially, certainly with every
appearance of liking him.  He had even of
late begun to fancy that her colour
heightened when he entered the room,&mdash;a
phenomenon which, if real, was
attributable rather to another cause, and
connected with Lawrence's presence in
the house.
</p>

<p>
After dinner the whole party went
out upon the verandah, a favourite
manoeuvre of Miss Cordelia's, whereby the
society of Mr. Brinsley was not wasted
upon smoke and men's talk in the
dining-room.  This evening, however,
instead of sitting down at once in her
usual place, Cordelia slipped her arm
through Fanny's, and led her off to the
other side and down the steps into the
garden.
</p>

<p>
"The moonlight is so lovely," said
Miss Cordelia, "and I want to talk to
you.  Let us walk a little&mdash;do you
mind?"
</p>

<p>
The two went along the path in
silence, in and out among the trees.
The moon was full.  From the sea
came up the sound of the tide, washing
the smooth rocks at high water.  The
breeze had died away at sunset and the
deep sky was cloudless.  Here and
there the greater stars twinkled softly,
but the little ones were all lost in the
moonlight, like diamonds in a pure
fountain.  Everything was asleep except the
watchful, wakeful sea.  The two women
stood still and looked across the lawn.
At last Miss Miner spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Why were you so unkind to Mr. Brinsley
to-night?" she asked in a low
voice.
</p>

<p>
Fanny glanced at her before she
answered.  The eldest Miss Miner's face
had once been almost beautiful.  In
the moonlight, the delicate, clearly
chiselled features were lovely still, but
a little ghostly, and the young girl saw
that the fixed smile had disappeared
for once, leaving a look of pain in its
place.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't mean to be unkind," Fanny
began.  "That is," she added quickly,
correcting herself, "I'm not quite sure
of what I meant.  I think I did mean
to hurt him.  He's so strong, and he's
always showing that he despises
Mr. Lawrence, because he isn't an athlete.
As though a man must be a prize-fighter
to be nice!"
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;but&mdash;Mr. Lawrence doesn't
mind.  You see how he takes it all.
Why should you fight battles for him?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I shouldn't.  But&mdash;why
should you take up the cudgels for
Mr. Brinsley?  He's quite able to take
care of himself, if he will only tell
the truth."
</p>

<p>
"If!" exclaimed Miss Cordelia, in
ready resentment.  "He's the most
truthful man alive."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  And he told you he had been
in the English navy."
</p>

<p>
"What has that to do with it?  Of
course he has, if he says so."
</p>

<p>
"He's unwise to say so, because he
hasn't," answered Fanny, in her usual
direct way.
</p>

<p>
"How in the world can you say that
a man like Mr. Brinsley&mdash;an
honourable man, I'm sure&mdash;is telling a
deliberate falsehood?  I'm surprised at you,
Fanny&mdash;indeed I am!  It isn't like you."
</p>

<p>
"Did you ever know me to tell you
anything that wasn't exactly true?"
asked the young girl, looking down into
her elderly cousin's sweet, sad face, for
she was much the taller.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;of course not&mdash;but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Cousin Cordelia, I tell you
that your Mr. Brinsley has never been
in the English navy.  I don't say that
I think so.  I say that I know it.  Will
you believe me, or him?'
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Fanny!"  Miss Cordelia raised
her eyes with a frightened glance.
</p>

<p>
"Not that it matters," added Fanny,
looking away across the moonlit lawn
again.  "Who cares?  Only, it's one
of those lies that go against a man,"
she continued after a short pause.
"A man may pretend that he has shot
ten million grisly bears in his back
yard, or hooked a salmon that weighed
a hundred-weight&mdash;people will laugh
and say that he's a story-teller.  It's
all right, you know&mdash;and nobody minds.
But when a man says he's been in the
army or the navy, and hasn't&mdash;people
call him a liar and cut him.  I don't
know why it's so, I'm sure, but it
is&mdash;and we all know it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered Cordelia, almost
tremulously; "but you haven't proved
that Mr. Brinsley isn't telling the
truth&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, I have!  There never was
a deep-sea sailor yet who had never
heard of club-hauling a ship to save
her.  I know about those things.  I
always make navy officers talk to me
about those things whenever I get a
chance.  Besides, I can prove it to
you.  Ask the first captain of a
fishing-schooner you meet down at the
landing what it means.  But don't tell me
I don't know&mdash;it's too absurd."
</p>

<p>
Miss Cordelia looked down.  Her
hand still rested on Fanny's arm, and
it trembled now so that the young girl
felt it.
</p>

<p>
"What does it mean, then?" asked
Cordelia, faintly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's a long operation to tell
about.  It's when you've got a
lee-shore in a gale, and you want to go
about and can't, because you miss
stays every time, and you let go an
anchor, and the ship swings to it, and
just as she begins to get way on, you
slip your chain, and she pays off on the
other tack.  Of course you lose your
anchor."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;you lose the anchor?  To
save the ship?  I see."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly."
</p>

<p>
"You lose the anchor to save the
ship," repeated Cordelia, softly, as
though she were trying to remember
the words for future use.  "Shall we go
back?" she suggested, rather abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"I wish you'd answer me one question
first," said Fanny.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Why are you so awfully anxious to
stand up for Mr. Brinsley?  You're not
in love with him, are you?"
</p>

<p>
Cordelia started very perceptibly, and
turned her face away.  Then, all at
once, she laughed a little hysterically.
</p>

<p>
"In love?  At my age?"
</p>

<p>
And she laughed again, and laughed,
strange to say, till she cried, clinging
all the time to the young girl's strong
arm.  Fanny did not ask any more
questions as they walked slowly back
to the house.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
</h3>

<p>
"Come with me into the village, and
help me to do errands," said Fanny on
the following morning, just as Lawrence
was feeling for his pipe in his pocket
after breakfast.  "You can smoke till
we get there.  It wouldn't hurt you to
smoke less, anyway."
</p>

<p>
They went down through the garden,
fresh and dewy still from the short, cool
night, towards the sea.  The path to
the village lies along a low sea-wall, just
high enough and strong enough to keep
the tide from the lawns.  But the tide
was beginning to run out at that hour,
and was singing and rocking itself away
from the shore, leaving the big loose
stones and the chocolate-coloured rocks
all wet and shining in the morning sun.
The breeze was springing up in the
offing and would reach the land before
long, kissing each island as it passed
softly by, and gently breaking with
dark blue the smoothly undulating
water.
</p>

<p>
The sun was almost behind the pair
as they walked along the sands, and
shone full upon the harbour as it came
into view, lighting up the deep green of
the islands between which passes the
channel, and bringing up the warm
brown of the soil through thick weaving
spruces.  The graceful yachts caught
the sunshine, too, their hulls gleaming
darkly, or dazzlingly white, their slender
masts pencilled in light, against the
trees, and standing out like threaded
needles when they showed against the
pale, clear sky.  In the bright northern
air, the artist would have complained that
there was no atmosphere&mdash;no 'depth,'
nor 'distance,' but only the distinct
farness of the objects a long way
off&mdash;nothing at all like 'atmospheric
perspective.'
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it a glorious day!" exclaimed
Fanny, looking seaward at a white-sailed
fishing-schooner, which scarcely
moved in the morning air.
</p>

<p>
"It's a little bit too swept and
garnished," answered Lawrence.  "That
is&mdash;for a picture, you know.  It's
better to feel than to look at, if you
understand what I mean.  It feels so northern,
that when you look at it, it seems bare
and unfinished without a little snow."
</p>

<p>
"But you like it, don't you?" asked
the young girl, in prompt protest.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I do.  What a question!
I thought I'd been showing how much
I liked it, ever since I got here."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not sure that you show what
you like and don't like," said Fanny,
in a tone of reflexion.  "Perhaps it's
better not to."
</p>

<p>
"You don't, at all events.  At
least&mdash;aren't you rather an inscrutable
person?  Of course I don't know," he
added rather foolishly, pulling his
woollen cap over his eyes and glancing at
her sideways.
</p>

<p>
"Inscrutable!  What a big word!  'The
inscrutable ways of Providence'&mdash;that's
what they always say, don't
they?  Still&mdash;if you mean that I don't
'tell,' you're quite right.  I don't&mdash;when
I can keep my countenance.  Do
you?  It's always far better not to tell.
Besides, if you commit yourself to an
opinion, you're committing yourself to
gaol."
</p>

<p>
"What a way of putting it!  But it's
really true.  I should so much like to
ask you a question about one of your
opinions."
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you?" asked Fanny,
turning her eyes to his.
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;lots of reasons: I'm afraid,
in the first place; and then, I'm not
sure you have one, and then&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Say it all&mdash;I hate people who hesitate!"
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;no.  There's a great deal
more to say than I want to say.  Let's
talk about the landscape."
</p>

<p>
"No.  I want to know what the
question is which you wished you might
ask," insisted Fanny.
</p>

<p>
"It's about Mr. Brinsley," said
Lawrence, plunging.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what about him?"  Fanny's
tone changed perceptibly, and her
expression grew cold and forbidding.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing particular&mdash;unless it's
impertinent&mdash;so I won't ask it."
</p>

<p>
"You won't?" asked Fanny, slackening
her pace and looking hard at
him.  "Not if I ask you to?"
</p>

<p>
"No," answered Lawrence.  "I'd
oblige you by asking a different
question, but not that one.  You wouldn't
know the difference."
</p>

<p>
"That's ingenuous, at all events."  She
looked away again and laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I never fight when I can help it,
and you looked dangerous just now.
You always are, in one way or another."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Only that when you don't happen
to be frightening me out of my wits, you
are charming me into a perfect idiot."
</p>

<p>
"Something between an express train
and the Lorelei," laughed Fanny.
</p>

<p>
But the quick, girlish blood had
sprung to her sunny cheeks and
lingered a moment, as though it loved the
light.  They were now in the village&mdash;in
the broad street where the shops are.
At that hour there were many people
moving about on foot and in every sort
of vehicle, short of broughams and
landaus.  There was the smart couple in
a high buckboard, just out for a
morning drive; there was the elderly farmer
with his buggy or his hooded cart&mdash;his
wife seated beside him, with her
queer, sad, winter-blighted face, and
her decent, but dusty black frock;&mdash;there
was the young farmer 'sport'
driving his favourite trotting horse in
a sulky.  And of pedestrians there was
no end.  A smart party bent on a day's
excursion by sea came down the board
walk, brilliant in perfectly new blue
and white serge, with bits of splendid
orange and red here and there, fresh
faces, light hearts, great appetites, and
the most trifling of cares&mdash;the care for
trifles themselves.  Fanny nodded and
smiled, and was smiled at, while
Lawrence attempted to lift his soft woollen
cap from his head with some sort of
grace&mdash;a thing impossible, as men
who wear soft woollen caps well know.
But the air seemed lighter and brighter
for so much youth laughing in it.
</p>

<p>
Fanny dived into one shop after
another, Lawrence following her, rather
awkwardly, as a man always does under
the circumstances, until he is old
enough to find out that there is a time
for watching as well as a time for
talking, and that more may be learned of
a woman's character from the way she
treats shopkeepers than is generally
supposed.  Fanny showed surprising
alternations of firmness and condescension,
for she had the gift of managing
people and of getting what she wanted,
which is a rare gift and one not to be
despised.  She asked very kindly after
the fishmonger's baby, but she did not
hesitate to tell the grocer the hardest
of truths about the butter.
</p>

<p>
"I always do my own marketing,"
she said to Lawrence, in answer to his
look of surprise.  "It amuses me, and
I get much better things.  My poor
dear cousins don't understand marketing
a bit&mdash;though they ought to.
That's the reason why they never get
on, somehow.  I believe marketing is
the best school in the world for
learning what's worth having and what isn't.
Don't you?"
</p>

<p>
"I never had a chance to learn,"
laughed Lawrence.  "I wish you'd
teach me how to get on, as you call it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;it's very easy!  You only
need know exactly what you want, and
then try to get it as hard as you can.
Most people don't know, and don't
try."
</p>

<p>
"For that matter I know perfectly
well what I want."
</p>

<p>
"Then why don't you try and get
it?" asked Fanny, pausing at the door
of another shop as though interested
in his answer.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not sure that it's in the market,"
answered the young man, his eyes
in hers.
</p>

<p>
"Have you enquired?"  Fanny's
mouth twitched with the coming smile.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;not exactly.  I'm trying to
find out by inspection."
</p>

<p>
"If you don't think it's likely to be
too dear, you'd better ask&mdash;whatever
it is."
</p>

<p>
"Money couldn't buy it.  Besides,
I've got none," added Lawrence.
</p>

<p>
"You might get it on credit," said
Fanny.  "But I think it's very doubtful."
</p>

<p>
Thereupon she entered the shop, and
Lawrence followed her, meditating
deeply upon his chances, and asking
himself whether he should run the great
risk at once, or wait and watch Brinsley.
To tell the truth, he thought his
own chances very small; for he
under-estimated all his advantages by looking
at them in the light of his present
poverty, not seeing that in so doing he might
be underestimating Fanny Trehearne as
well.  A somewhat excessive caution,
which sometimes goes with timidity,
though not at all of the sort which
produces cowardice, is often the result of
an education which has not brought a
man closely into competition with other
men.  No one in common sense, save
the Miss Miners and Lawrence himself,
could have imagined that Brinsley had
a chance against him.  For anything
that people knew, Brinsley might turn
out to be an adventurer of the worst
kind, whereas Lawrence was of good
birth, a man of whom many knew who
he was, and whence he came, and that
he had as good a right to ask for
Fanny's hand as any man.  He was poor
just now, but no one believed that his
rich uncle, a childless widower of
fifty-five, would marry again, and Lawrence
was sure to have money in the end,
though he might wait thirty years for it.
</p>

<p>
As for Brinsley, Fanny Trehearne
either could not or would not pretend
that she liked him, even in the most
moderate degree of distant liking, after
she had satisfied herself that he was
not a truthful person in those matters
in which truth decides the right of a
man to be considered honourable.
Being, on the whole, more careful than
most people about the accuracy of
what she said, she was less inclined to
make allowances for others than a
great many of her contemporaries.
Besides, Brinsley had not only told a
lie, which was mean in itself, but he
had allowed himself to be found out,
which Fanny considered contemptible.
</p>

<p>
Up to this time she had seemed to
think him very pleasant company and
not a bad addition to the society of
the place.
</p>

<p>
"He's so good-looking!" she had
often said to the approving Miss Miners.
"And he has good manners, and knows
how to come into a room, and how to
sit down and get up&mdash;and do lots of
things," she added vaguely.
</p>

<p>
In this opinion her three old-maid
cousins fully concurred, and they were
quite ready to say as much in his
favour as Fanny could have heard
without laughing.  They were therefore
greatly distressed when she changed
her mind.
</p>

<p>
"He's handsome," Fanny now admitted.
"But he's a little too showy.
I've seen men like him at races, but
they were not the men who were introduced
to me.  I don't think they knew
anybody I knew&mdash;that sort of man,
don't you know?  And his English
accent isn't quite English, and I don't
like his little flat whiskers, and his hands
irritate me.  Besides, he said he had
been in the navy, and now he admits
that he never was.  That's enough."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Fanny," Cordelia answered,
on such occasions, "there was
a misunderstanding about that, you
know.  He was in the navy, since he
was an officer of Marines, but of course
he wasn't expected to know&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The Marines!" exclaimed Fanny,
contemptuously.  "It's only a way of
getting out of it, I'm sure!"
</p>

<p>
Thereupon the three Miss Miners
told her that she was very unjust and
prejudiced, as they retired together to
praise Mr. Brinsley, out of hearing of
their young cousin's tart comment.
Miss Cordelia had made it all right
by giving the man an opportunity of
justifying himself after he had privately
explained to her that the Marines were
an integral part of the navy, but that
they were not called upon to know
anything about navigation,&mdash;a fact
which must account for his ignorance.
</p>

<p>
He had very firm friends, to say the
least of it, in the three spinsters, who
might have been said to worship the
ground on which he walked, and who
thought it a sin and a shame that
Fanny should treat him as she did.
As for young Lawrence, he looked on,
with his observant artist's eyes, and
never mentioned Brinsley, except to
Fanny herself.  For he was not at all
lacking in tact, however deficient he
might be in the manly accomplishments.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know," Fanny began, one
day when they were walking in the
woods, "I don't half mind you're being
such a bad hand at things.  It's funny.
I thought I should, at first&mdash;but I
don't."
</p>

<p>
"I'm awfully glad," answered Lawrence,
not finding anything else to say
to express his gratitude.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you may well be!" laughed
Fanny.  "I don't forgive everybody for
being a duffer.  And that's what you
are, you know.  You don't mind my
saying so?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, not at all."  The tone in
which he spoke did not express much
conviction, however.
</p>

<p>
"I believe you do," said Fanny,
thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
They were following a narrow path
which led upwards along the bank of a
brook under overarching trees.  Here
and there the bank had fallen away,
and the woodmen had laid down 'slabs'
of the rippings first taken off by the
saw-mill in squaring timber.  It was
damp under foot, for it had lately
rained, and the wet, chocolate-coloured
dead leaves of the previous year filled
the chinks between the bits of wood,
and sometimes lay all over them, a
slippery mass.  It was still and hot
and damp all through the thick growth
on the midsummer's afternoon.  The
whispered mystery of countless living
things filled the quiet air with a
vibration more felt than heard, which
overcame the silence, but did not break
the stillness.
</p>

<p>
The path was very narrow, and Fanny
had to walk before her companion.
Their voices seemed to echo back to
them from very near, as they talked,
for amongst the trees the rich
undergrowth grew man-high.  On their right,
below them, the brook laughed softly
to itself as a faun might laugh,
drowsily, half asleep in a hollow of the
deep woods.
</p>

<p>
And then, through the warm-breathing
secret places, where all that was
living was growing fiercely in the
sudden summer, stole the heart-thrilling
fragrance of all that lived, than which
nothing more surely stirs young blood
in the glory of the year.
</p>

<p>
For some minutes the pair walked
on in silence, Fanny leading.  The
young man watched the strong, lithe
figure of the girl as she moved swiftly
and sure-footed before him.  Suddenly
she stopped, without turning round,
and she seemed to be listening.  A low
ray of sunlight ran quivering through
the trees and played with a crisp
ringlet of her hair, too full of life and
strength to be smoothed to dull order
with the rest.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" asked Lawrence, in a
low voice, watching her.
</p>

<p>
"I thought I heard some one in the
woods," she answered quickly, and then
listened again.
</p>

<p>
Not a sound broke the dream-like
stillness.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure I heard something," said
Fanny.  Then she laughed a little.
"Besides," she added, "it's very likely.
It's awfully hot.  Here's a good place
to sit down."
</p>

<p>
It was not a particularly good place,
being damp and sloping, and Lawrence
planted his heels firmly amongst the
wet, dead leaves to keep himself from
slipping down into the path as he sat
beside her.
</p>

<p>
"There's always something going
on in the woods," she said softly and
dreamily.  "The trees talk to each
other all day long, and the squirrels sit
and crack nuts while they listen to the
conversation.  I like the woods.
Somehow one never feels alone when one
gets where things grow&mdash;does one?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't mind being alone when I
can't be&mdash;I mean&mdash;"  Lawrence did
not finish his sentence, but bent down
and picked up a twig from the ground.
"Isn't it funny!" he exclaimed,
twisting it in his hands.  "All the bark's
loose, and turns round."
</p>

<p>
"Of course&mdash;it's an old twig, and
it's wet.  When don't you mind being
alone?  You were saying something&mdash;'when
you couldn't be with'&mdash;something,
or somebody."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;you know!  What's the use
of my saying it?"  Lawrence kept his
eye on the twig.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, and if I want you to
say anything, that's the use," answered
Fanny, whose prose style, so to say,
was direct if it was anything.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;but you see&mdash;I didn't
mean anything in particular."  He
broke the twig in two and tossed it
over the path into the brook below.
</p>

<p>
Fanny changed her position a little,
leaning forward and clasping her gloved
hands round her knees.
</p>

<p>
"You're very nice, you know," she
said meditatively.  "I like you."
</p>

<p>
"Because I don't answer your questions?"
asked Lawrence, looking at her
face, which was half turned from him.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  That's one of the reasons."
</p>

<p>
"It's a very funny one.  I don't see
much reason in it, I confess."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you?  Don't you know that
a woman sometimes likes a man for
what he doesn't say?"
</p>

<p>
"I never thought of it in that way.
I daresay you're right.  You ought to
know much better than I do.  Especially
if you really like me, as you say
you do."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;I'm honest.  I never said
I'd been in the navy!"  Fanny laughed.
"Besides, if I didn't like you, why
should I say so?  Just to say
something civil?  The way Mr. Brinsley
does?"
</p>

<p>
"Brinsley's a horror!  Don't talk
about him&mdash;especially here."
</p>

<p>
"I don't mean to.  I hate him.
But if we were going to talk about him,
this would be a good place&mdash;one's
sure that he's not just round the
corner of the verandah making one of
my three cousins miserable."
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;they all love him.  Can't
you see it?  I don't mean figuratively.
Not a bit.  They're in love with him,
poor dears!"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense! not really?" Lawrence
laughed incredulously.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;really.  It's a rather dismal
sort of love&mdash;they've kept their
hearts in pickle for such an age, you
know&mdash;old pickles aren't good, either.
I've no patience with old maids who
fall in love and make fools of
themselves!"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps they can't help it,"
suggested the young man.  "Nobody can
help falling in love, you know."
</p>

<p>
"No," answered Fanny, rather
doubtfully.  "Perhaps not.  I don't
know.  It depends."
</p>

<p>
"People don't generally try to keep
themselves from falling in love,"
remarked Lawrence, with the air of a
philosopher.  "It's more apt to be the
other way.  They are generally trying
to make some one else fall in love with
them.  That's the hard thing."
</p>

<p>
"Is it?"  Fanny smiled.  "Perhaps
it is," she added, after a pause.  "I'd
like to tell you something&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She hesitated and stopped.  Lawrence
looked at her, but did not speak,
expecting her to go on.  The silence
continued for some time.  Once or
twice Fanny turned and met his eyes,
and her lips moved as though she were
just going to say something.  She
seemed to be in doubt.
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe in friendship, and
I don't believe in promises,&mdash;and I
don't believe much in anything," she
said at last, in magnificent generalization.
"But I'd like to tell you, all the
same.  Do you mind?"
</p>

<p>
"I won't repeat it if you do," said
Lawrence, simply.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;I don't believe you will.
You see I haven't any friends, so I
never tell things,&mdash;at least, not much.
I don't believe much in telling, anyway.
Do you?"
</p>

<p>
"Not if you mean to keep a secret."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;well&mdash;this isn't exactly a
secret&mdash;only I don't want any one to
know it.  Yes, I know!  You laugh
because I'm going to tell you.  But
you're different, somehow&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Am I?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes,&mdash;you don't count!"
</p>

<p>
Lawrence's face fell a little at this
last remark, and there was silence again
for a few moments.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not sure that I'll tell you, after
all," said Fanny, at last.
</p>

<p>
The quiet lids were half closed over
the grey eyes, and she seemed to be
thinking out something.  Lawrence was
unconsciously wondering why he did
not think the white lashes ugly,
especially when she had just told him that
he did not 'count.'
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure you won't tell?"
asked the young girl, after another long
pause.
</p>

<p>
"If you don't want me to, of course
I won't," answered Lawrence, mechanically.
</p>

<p>
"It's a sort of confession," said
Fanny.  "That's the reason why I
don't like to tell you.  It's cowardly
to be afraid of confessing that one's
been an idiot, so I am going to do it
at once and get it over."
</p>

<p>
"It's a startling confession!" laughed
Lawrence, softly.  "I don't believe it.
Is that all?"
</p>

<p>
"If you laugh at me, I won't tell you
anything more.  Then you'll be sorry."
</p>

<p>
"Shall I?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"All right!  I'm serious now," said
Lawrence.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you want to smoke?" asked
Fanny, suddenly.  "I wish you would.
I should be less&mdash;less nervous, you
know."
</p>

<p>
"What a curious idea!  But I'll
smoke if you like."
</p>

<p>
He proceeded to fill and light a big
brier-root pipe.
</p>

<p>
"I like the smell of a pipe," said
Fanny, watching the operation.  "I'm
so tired of the everlasting cigarette."
</p>

<p>
"I'm ready," Lawrence said, puffing
slowly into the still, hot air.
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure you won't laugh at
me?  Well, I'll tell you.  I liked
Mr. Brinsley awfully&mdash;at first."
</p>

<p>
Lawrence looked at her quickly and
took his pipe from his mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Not really?" he exclaimed, only
half-interrogatively, but with a change
of colour.  "But then&mdash;well&mdash;I don't
suppose you mean anything particular
by that," he added, to comfort himself.
"You don't mean that you&mdash;"  He
stopped.
</p>

<p>
Fanny nodded slowly, and the blush
that rose in her face reddened her sunny
complexion.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  That's what I mean.  I cared
for him, you know,&mdash;that sort of thing."
</p>

<p>
"It hasn't taken you long to get over
it, at all events," answered Lawrence,
gravely, and wondering inwardly why
she made the extraordinary confession,
seeing that it hurt him and could do
her no good.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;it hasn't taken long, has it?
That's what frightens me.  If I weren't
frightened, I shouldn't talk to you about
it."
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand&mdash;why are you
frightened?  Especially since you've
got over it.  I don't see&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I thought you might," said Fanny,
enigmatically.
</p>

<p>
A long silence followed, this time.
Lawrence crossed his hands on his
knees as Fanny was doing, holding his
pipe, which was going out.  They both
sat staring at the opposite bank of the
brook.
</p>

<p>
The vital loveliness of the still woods
was all around them, whispering in their
young ears, breathing into their young
nostrils the breath of nature's life,
caressing them with bountiful warmth.
They sat side by side, very near, staring
at the opposite bank, and for a long
time no words passed their lips.  At
last the young girl spoke in a low and
almost monotonous tone.
</p>

<p>
"He has an influence over people
who come near him," she said.
"Besides, that kind of man appeals to me.
It's natural, isn't it?  I'm so fond of
all sorts of things out-of-doors, that I
can't help admiring a man who can do
everything so well.  And he's a splendid
creature.  You've never seen him ride.
You don't know&mdash;it's wonderful!  I
wish you could see him on that
thoroughbred Teddy Van De Water has
brought up this summer&mdash;Teddy's a
good rider, but he can't do anything
with the mare.  You ought to see
Brinsley&mdash;Mr. Brinsley&mdash;you'd understand
better."
</p>

<p>
"But I understand perfectly, as it
is," said Lawrence, rather gloomily.
</p>

<p>
"Do you?  I wonder whether you
really do.  Do you think there's
any&mdash;any excuse for me?"
</p>

<p>
The words were spoken in a faltering
shamefaced way very unlike Fanny's
usual manner.
</p>

<p>
"As though you needed any excuse
for taking a fancy to any one who
pleases you!" answered Lawrence,
rather coldly.  "Aren't you perfectly
free to like anybody who turns up?"
</p>

<p>
During the pause which followed, he
slowly relighted his pipe, which had
quite gone out by this time.
</p>

<p>
"I was afraid you wouldn't understand,"
said Fanny, in a disappointed
tone.
</p>

<p>
"But I do&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;not what I mean.  I hate
explaining things, but I shall have to."
</p>

<p>
Louis Lawrence wondered vaguely
what there could be to explain, and, if
there were anything, why she should
be so anxious to explain to him in
particular.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
</h3>

<p>
"It was in this way," said Fanny.
"Mr. Brinsley brought a letter of
introduction from Cousin Frank.  You
know who Frank is, don't you?  He's
the brother of the three Miss Miners."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," nodded Lawrence.
"Everybody knows Frank Miner."
</p>

<p>
"And he knows everybody.  But he
didn't say much in his note, and
Cordelia has written to him since, because
she wants to know all about Mr. Brinsley,
and it appears that Frank has only
met him once or twice at a club, and
doesn't know anything about him.
However, it doesn't matter!  The main
point is that he called the day after
we got here, and in twenty-four hours
we were all in love with him."
</p>

<p>
"Please don't include yourself," said
Lawrence, his delicate face betraying
that he winced.
</p>

<p>
"I will include myself, because it's
true," answered Fanny, very much in
earnest.  "I shouldn't put it just in
that way about myself, perhaps,&mdash;but
I took a fancy to him, and I took him
to drive, and I found that he could
drive quite as well as I, and we went out
riding with a party, and he rides like an
angel&mdash;he really does&mdash;it's divine.
And then I tried him in the boat, and
he was good at that.  So I began to
like him very much."
</p>

<p>
"They're all excellent reasons for
liking a man," observed Lawrence,
with a little contempt.
</p>

<p>
"Don't scoff at things you can't do
yourself," said Fanny, severely.  "It's
not in good taste.  Besides, I don't
care.  All women admire men who are
stronger, and quicker, and better with
their hands than other men.  One
always thinks they must be braver, too."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that's true," assented Lawrence,
seeking to retrieve himself by
meekness.
</p>

<p>
"And they generally are.  It takes
courage to ride well, and it needs nerve
to handle a boat in a squall.  I don't
mean to say that you can't be brave if
you don't know how to do those things.
That would be nonsense.  You&mdash;for
instance&mdash;you could learn.  Only
nobody has ever taught you anything,
and you're getting old."
</p>

<p>
Lawrence laughed outright, and
forgot his ill-humour in a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;I don't mean really old,"
said Fanny, immediately.  "I only
mean that one ought to learn when
one is a child, as I did.  Then it's no
trouble, you see&mdash;and one never
forgets.  Now, Mr. Brinsley began
young&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," interrupted the young man,
"I should say so.  I'm sorry I didn't."
</p>

<p>
"So am I.  It would have been so
nice to do things&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She stopped abruptly, and pulled up
a blade of rank grass, which she
proceeded to twist thoughtfully round her
finger.
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't like you to think I was
a flirt," she said, suddenly turning her
grey eyes upon him.
</p>

<p>
He met her glance curiously, being
considerably surprised by her remark.
</p>

<p>
"Because I sometimes think I am,
myself," she added, still looking at
him.  "Do you think so?" she asked
earnestly.  "What is a flirt, anyway?"
</p>

<p>
"A woman who draws a man on for
the pleasure of breaking his heart, I
suppose," answered Lawrence, keeping
his eyes fixed intently on hers.
</p>

<p>
"Then I'm only half a flirt," said
Fanny, "because I only draw a man
on, without meaning to break
anybody's heart."
</p>

<p>
"Don't," said Lawrence.  "It hurts,
you know."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder&mdash;"  The young girl
laughed a little, and turned away from
his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
"Whether it really hurts."  She bit
the end of the grass blade, and slowly
tore it with her teeth, looking dreamily
across the brook.
</p>

<p>
"Don't try it, at all events."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Brinsley doesn't seem to mind."
</p>

<p>
"Brinsley isn't a human being," said
Lawrence, savagely.
</p>

<p>
"What is he, then?"
</p>

<p>
"A fraud&mdash;of some sort.  I don't
care.  I hate him!"
</p>

<p>
"You're hard on Mr. Brinsley,"
observed Fanny, slowly, and watching
her companion sideways.
</p>

<p>
"Considering what you've been
saying about him&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I said nothing about him except
that I began by liking him awfully."
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;you left the rest to my
imagination.  I did as well as I could.
If you didn't hate him yourself, you'd
hardly have been telling me all this,
would you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;I don't know.  I might be
going to ask your advice
about&mdash;about him."
</p>

<p>
"Take him out in your boat and
drown him," suggested Lawrence.
"That's my advice about him."
</p>

<p>
"What has he done to you, Mr. Lawrence?"
enquired Fanny, gravely.
"Why do you hate him so?"
</p>

<p>
"Why?  It's plain enough, it seems
to me&mdash;plain as a&mdash;what do you call
the thing?"
</p>

<p>
"Plain as a marlinespike, you mean.
Only it isn't.  I want to know two
things.  Do you think I'm a flirt?
And why do you want me to murder
poor, innocent Mr. Brinsley?  Do you
mind answering?"
</p>

<p>
Lawrence's dark eyes began to gleam
angrily.  He bit his pipe and pulled at
it, though it had gone out; then he
took it from his lips and answered
deliberately.
</p>

<p>
"If you are a flirt, Miss Trehearne,
I don't wish Brinsley any further
damage.  He'll do very well in your hands,
I'm sure.  I have no anxiety."
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't hurt a fly," said Fanny.
"If I liked the fly," she added.
</p>

<p>
"I believe the spider said something
to the same effect, when he invited the
fly into his parlour."
</p>

<p>
At this a dark flush rose in the girl's
cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"You're rude, Mr. Lawrence," she said.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry, Miss Trehearne&mdash;but
you're unkind, so you'll please to excuse
me."
</p>

<p>
Instead of flushing, as she did,
Lawrence turned slowly pale, as was his
nature.
</p>

<p>
"Even if I were,&mdash;but I'm not,&mdash;that's
no reason why you should be rude."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't mean to be rude,"
answered Lawrence.  "I don't see what
I said that was so very dreadful."
</p>

<p>
"It was much worse than anything I
said," retorted Fanny, biting her blade
of grass again.  "Because I didn't say
anything at all, you know.  Oh, well&mdash;if
you'll say you're sorry, we'll bury it."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," said Lawrence, without
the least show of contrition.
</p>

<p>
"I was going to tell you such lots of
things about myself," said the young
girl.  "You've made me forget them
all.  What was I talking about when we
began to fight?  I began by saying that
I liked you, and you've been horrid ever
since.  I won't say that again, at all
events."
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me&mdash;you began by saying
that you'd liked Brinsley&mdash;liked him
awfully, you said.  It must have been
awful&mdash;anything connected with
Brinsley is necessarily awful."
</p>

<p>
"There you go again.  Don't bolt so&mdash;it
makes bad running.  I told you
why I'd liked him so much at first, and
you admitted that it was natural.  Do
you remember that?  Well&mdash;that isn't
all.  After I liked him, I began to care
for him.  I told you that, too.  Horrid
of me, wasn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Horrid!"
</p>

<p>
"I wish you wouldn't agree with me
all the time!" exclaimed Fanny,
impatiently.  "You know I really did
care&mdash;a little.  And then one day in the
catboat, he asked me&mdash;" She stopped
and looked at Lawrence.
</p>

<p>
"To marry you?  Why don't you say
it?  It wouldn't surprise me a bit."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Fanny, slowly, "he didn't
ask me to marry him."
</p>

<p>
"In Heaven's name, what did he ask
you?" enquired Lawrence, exasperated
to impatience.
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;I don't know.  It was something
about the channel between Bar
and Sheep, I believe.  Nothing very
important, anyway.  I'm not sure that
I could remember, if I tried."
</p>

<p>
"Then&mdash;excuse me, but what's the
point?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;I know!" exclaimed Fanny,
as though suddenly recollecting
something.  "Not that it matters much, but
I like to be accurate.  It was about the
bell buoy off Sheep Porcupine.  You
know, I showed it to you the other day.
Well&mdash;I told him how it had been
carried away in a storm some time ago,
and that this was a new one.  And the
next day I heard him telling Augusta
all about it, as though he had known
before, you see."
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;that wasn't exactly a crime,"
observed Lawrence, who could not
understand at all.  "You'd told him&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but he said he remembered
the old one.  That was impossible,
as he hadn't known anything about
it.  It was a little slip, but it made
me open my eyes and watch him.  I
used to think he was perfection until
then."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I see!  That was when you first
began to find out that he wasn't quite
straight."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly.  It made all the difference.
I've caught him out more than once
since then.  The other night, it was too
much for me, when he talked about the
navy&mdash;so I promptly smashed him.
He knows that I know, now."
</p>

<p>
"I should think so.  All the same&mdash;I
don't mean to be rude this time, Miss
Trehearne&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Be careful!"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;I'll risk it.  Just now when
you said he had 'asked you'&mdash;you
stopped short.  You knew I should
believe that you had been going to say
that he had asked you to marry him,
didn't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I know!  I couldn't help it&mdash;I
believe I really am a flirt, after all."
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't like to believe it," said
Lawrence, gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Nor I&mdash;either.  I only wanted to
see how you'd look if you thought he'd
offered himself just then."
</p>

<p>
"Just then!  Do you mean to say
that he has offered himself at any other
time?"
</p>

<p>
"Now you're rude again&mdash;only, I
forgive you, because you don't know
that you are.  It's rude to ask such
questions&mdash;so I'll be polite and refuse
to answer.  Not that there's any good
reason why he shouldn't have asked me
to marry him, you know.  The fact that
you hate him isn't a reason."
</p>

<p>
"But you do, yourself&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all.  At least, I haven't said
so.  I wish you'd listen to me,
Mr. Lawrence, instead of interrupting me
with questions every other moment.
How in the world am I to make a
confession, if you won't let me say two
words?"
</p>

<p>
"Are you going to make a confession?"
asked Lawrence, incredulously.
"It's all chaff, you know!"
</p>

<p>
Fanny turned her cool eyes upon
him instantly.
</p>

<p>
"There's a lot besides chaff," she
said, in a very different tone.  "I can
be in earnest, too&mdash;when I care."
</p>

<p>
She certainly emphasized the last
three words in a way which might have
meant much, accompanied as they were
by her steady look.  Lawrence felt
himself growing a little pale again.
</p>

<p>
"Do you care?" he asked, and his
voice shook perceptibly.
</p>

<p>
"For Mr. Brinsley?" enquired Fanny,
instantly changing her tone again and
beginning to laugh.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;for me."
</p>

<p>
"For you!  Oh dear, what a
question!"  She laughed outright.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence leaned down and knocked
the ashes out of his pipe against the
toe of his heavy walking-shoe without
saying a word.  Then he put the pipe
into his pocket.  She watched him.
</p>

<p>
"You've no right to be angry this
time," she said.  "But you are."
</p>

<p>
The young man faced her quietly
and waited a moment before he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"You're playing with me," he said,
calmly and without emphasis, as stating
a fact.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I am!" laughed Fanny
Trehearne.  "What did you expect?
But I'm sorry that you've found it out,"
she added, with appalling cynicism.
"It won't be fun any more."
</p>

<p>
"Unless we both play," suggested
Lawrence, who had either recovered
his temper very quickly, or possessed
a better control over it than Fanny had
supposed.
</p>

<p>
"All right!" she exclaimed
cheerfully.  "Let's play&mdash;let us play.  That
sounds solemn, somehow&mdash;I wonder
why?  Oh&mdash;of course&mdash;it's like 'Let
us pray' in church."
</p>

<p>
Lawrence laughed drily.
</p>

<p>
"Let us pray beforehand, for the one
who gets the worst of it," he said.  "He
or she will need it.  But I shall win at
the game, you know.  That's a
foregone conclusion."
</p>

<p>
Fanny was surprised and amused at
the confidence he suddenly affected&mdash;very
unlike his habitual modesty and
self-effacement.
</p>

<p>
"You seem pretty sure of yourself,"
she answered.  "What shall the forfeit
be, as they say in the children's
games?"
</p>

<p>
"To marry or not to marry, at the
discretion of the winner.  I think that's
fair, don't you?  I shouldn't like to
propose anything serious&mdash;the head
of Roger Brinsley in a charger, for
instance."
</p>

<p>
Fanny laughed again.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's all very well!" she
protested.  "But of course the one who
loses will be in earnest, and the one
who wins will not."
</p>

<p>
"He may be, by that time,"
suggested Lawrence.
</p>

<p>
"Don't say 'he,' so confidently&mdash;I
mean to win.  Besides, are we starting
fair?  Of course I don't care an atom
for you, but don't you care for
me&mdash;just a little?"
</p>

<p>
"I!" exclaimed Lawrence.  "What
an idea!"  He laughed quite as
naturally as Fanny herself.  "Do you think
that a man in love would propose such a
game as we are talking about?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure I don't know what to
think," answered the young girl.
"Perhaps I shall know in a day or two."
</p>

<p>
She looked down, quite grave again,
and pulled a bit of fern from the bank,
and crushed it in her hand, and then
smelled it.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you like sweet fern?" she
asked, holding it out to him.  "I love it!"
</p>

<p>
"That's why you crush it, I suppose,"
said Lawrence.
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't smell sweet unless you
do.  Oh&mdash;I see!  You were beginning
to play the game.  Very well.
Why should we lose time about it?
But I wish it were a little better
defined.  What is it we're going to do?
Won't you explain?  I'm so stupid
about these things.  Are we going to
flirt for a bet?"
</p>

<p>
"What a speech!"
</p>

<p>
"Because it's a plain one?  Is that
why you object to it?  After all, that's
what we said."
</p>

<p>
"We only said we'd play," answered
Lawrence.  "Whichever ends by
caring must agree to marry the winner,
if required.  But I'm afraid the time
is too short," he added, more gravely.
"I've only a week more."
</p>

<p>
"Only a week!" exclaimed Fanny,
in a tone of disappointment.  "Why,
I thought there was ever so much more.
That isn't nearly time enough."
</p>

<p>
"We must play faster&mdash;and hope
for 'situations,' as they call them on
the stage."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;the situation is bad enough,
as it is," answered the young girl, with
a change of manner that surprised her
companion.  "If you only knew!"
</p>

<p>
"Was that what you were going to
tell me about?" asked Lawrence,
quickly, and with renewed interest.
"I thought you were making game
of me."
</p>

<p>
"That's the trouble!  You'll never
believe that I'm in earnest, now.
That's the worst of practical jokes.
Come along!  We must be going
home.  The sun's behind the hill and
ever so low, I'm sure.  We shan't get
home before dusk.  How sweet that
fern smells!  Give it back to me, won't
you?"
</p>

<p>
They rose and began to walk homeward
in the warm shadow of the woods.
As before, Fanny went first along the
narrow path, and Lawrence, following
close behind her, and watching the
supple grace of her as she moved,
breathed in also the intoxicating
perfume of the aromatic sweet fern which
she still carried in her hand.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
</h3>

<p>
On the following afternoon Fanny
Trehearne announced her intention of
riding with Mr. Brinsley.
</p>

<p>
"I'd take you, too," she said to
Lawrence, with a singularly cold stare.
"Only as you can't ride much, you
wouldn't enjoy it, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not," answered Lawrence,
returning her glance with all coolness.
"I shouldn't enjoy it at all."
</p>

<p>
"You might take my cousins out in
the boat, instead."
</p>

<p>
"Are they tired of life?" enquired
the young man, smiling.  "No.  I want
to make a sketch in the woods.  I'll
go out by myself, thank you."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to sketch the place
where we stopped yesterday?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh no&mdash;I'm going in quite another
direction.  I can't exactly explain where
it is, because I've such a bad memory
for names of roads, and all that.  But
I can find it."
</p>

<p>
Miss Cordelia Miner looked up from
the magazine she was reading.
</p>

<p>
"You're not going to ride alone with
Mr. Brinsley, are you?" she asked
suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" asked Fanny.  "I
don't see any reason why I shouldn't,
It's safer than riding alone, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"I confess, I don't like the idea,"
said Miss Cordelia.  "It looks as
though there were something."
</p>

<p>
"Something of what kind?" Fanny
watched Lawrence's face.
</p>

<p>
"Something&mdash;well&mdash;not really an
engagement&mdash;but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;why shouldn't I be engaged
to Mr. Brinsley, if I like?" enquired
the young girl, arching her brows.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Fanny!  I'm surprised!"  And,
indeed, Miss Miner seemed so,
for she almost sprang out of her chair.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know why you need be horrified,
though," returned Fanny, calmly.
"Should you be shocked if any one
said that you were engaged to
Mr. Brinsley?  What's the matter with him,
anyway?" she demanded, dropping
into her favourite slang.  "You'd be
proud to be engaged to him&mdash;so would
Elizabeth&mdash;so would Augusta!  Then
why shouldn't I be proud if I can get
him?  I'm sure, he's awfully good-looking,
and he rides&mdash;like an angel."
</p>

<p>
"An angel jockey," suggested
Lawrence, without a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all!" exclaimed Fanny.
"He rides like a gentleman and not
in the least like a jockey."
</p>

<p>
Miss Cordelia had risen from her
chair, and turned her back on the
young people.
</p>

<p>
"You've no right to say such things
to me, Fanny," she said, going slowly
towards the window.  Her voice shook.
</p>

<p>
The young girl saw that she was
deeply hurt, and followed her quickly.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't mean to be horrid!" said
Fanny, penitently.  "I was only
laughing, you know, and of course I shall
take Stebbins.  And I'm not engaged
to Mr. Brinsley at all."
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you say so at once?"
asked Cordelia, half choking, and
turning away her face.
</p>

<p>
Fanny, unseen by her cousin, glanced
at Lawrence, and then at the door, and
the young man departed immediately,
leaving the two cousins to make
peace.
</p>

<p>
He did not remain long in the house.
Thrusting a sketch-book and a pencil
into his pocket, with his pipe and
pouch, he went out without seeing
Fanny again, taking her at her word
with regard to her plans for the
afternoon.  An hour later, he was seated
under a tree high upon the side of
the hill and almost out of sight
of the Otter Cliff road.  There was
nothing particular in the way of a
view from that point, but there were
endless trees, and Lawrence amused
himself in making a rough study of a
mixed group of white pines, firs, and
hackmatacks.
</p>

<p>
He did not draw very carefully, nor
even industriously, and more than once
he stopped working altogether for a
quarter of an hour at a time.  His
principal object in coming had been to
get out of the way just a little more
promptly and completely than Fanny
could have expected.  His thoughts
were much more concerned with her
than with what he was doing.
</p>

<p>
Naturally enough, he was trying to
understand the real bent of the girl's
feelings.  Setting aside the absurd chaff
which had formed a good deal of the
conversation on the previous afternoon,
he tried to extract from it enough of
truth to guide him, aiding himself by
recalling little circumstances as well
as words, for the one had often belied
the other.
</p>

<p>
He saw clearly that Fanny Trehearne
might have said to him, 'I like you,
but I do not love you&mdash;win me if you
can!'   But it was like her to propose
to 'flirt for a bet'&mdash;being at heart
perhaps less of a flirt than she
laughingly admitted herself to be.  But that
was not the point which chiefly
interested him.  What he wished to know
was, just how far that undefined liking
for him extended.  To speak in the
common phrase, he did not 'know
where he was' with her, and it seemed
that he had no means of finding out.
On the other hand, he knew very well
indeed that he himself was badly in
love.  The symptoms were not to be
mistaken, nor had he been in love
so often already as to make him
sceptical as to what he felt.  He was more
distrustful of the result than of the
impulse.
</p>

<p>
In his opinion Fanny was much too
frank to be a flirt.  Her directness was
one of her principal charms, though he
could not help suspecting that it must
be one of her chief weapons.  A little
hesitation is often less deceptive than
clear-eyed, outspoken truth.  But
Lawrence was no more able than most men
of his age&mdash;or, indeed, of any age&mdash;to
follow out a continuous train of
thought where a woman was concerned.
It is more often the woman's
personality that concerns us, unreasoning
men, than the probable direction of
her own reasoning about us.  We do
not make love to an argument, so to
speak, nor to a set of ideas, nor to a
preconceived opinion of our merits or
demerits.  We make love to our own
idea of what the woman is&mdash;and the
depth of our disillusionment is the
measure of our sincerity, when love is
gasping between the death-blow and
the death.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, what is called nowadays
analysis of human nature, belongs in
reality to transcendental thought.
'Transcendent' is defined as designating
that which lies beyond the bounds
of all possible experience.  So far as
we know, it is beyond those bounds to
enter into the intelligence of our
neighbour, subjectively, to identify ourselves
with him and to see and understand
the world with his eyes and mind.  It
follows that we are never sure of what
we are doing when we attempt to set
down exactly another man's train of
thought, and it follows also that few
are willing to recognize the result as at
all resembling the process of which
they are conscious within themselves.
On certain bases, all men can appeal
subjectively to all men, and all women
to all women.  But, as between the
sexes, all observation is objective and
tentative, whether it be that of the
author, condemned to analyze a
woman's character, or that of the man
in love and attempting to understand
the woman he loves.
</p>

<p>
And further, if we could see&mdash;as it
is pretended by some that we can see
on paper&mdash;precisely what is taking
place in the intelligence of those we
meet in the world, our friends would be
as unrecognizable to us as a dissected
man is unrecognizable for a human
being except in the eyes of a doctor.
The soul, laid bare, dissected, and
turned inside out, with real success,
would not be recognized by its dearest
friend, were it ever so truthful a soul.
We are all fundamentally and totally
incapable of expressing exactly what we
feel, and as we have no means of
conveying truth without some sort of
expression, we are helpless and are all
more or less hopelessly misunderstood&mdash;a
fact to which, if we please, we
may ascribe that variety which is
proverbially said to be the charm of life.
Doubtless, this is a literary heresy;
but it is a human truth a little above
literature.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence had never attempted to
write a book, but as he sat on the slope
above the Otter Cliff road, drawing
trees, it did not occur to him to draw a
picture of what he thought about the
inside of each tree, instead of a
representation of what he saw.  But he
made the usual fruitless attempt to
understand the woman he loved, and
to reason about her, and failed to do
either, which is also usual.  The
conclusion he reached was that he loved
her, of which he had been aware before
he had set himself to think it out.
</p>

<p>
What he saw was a strong girl's face
with cool, inscrutable grey eyes that
never took fire and gleamed, nor ever
turned dull and vacant.  Their unchanging
steadiness contradicted the wayward
speech, the sudden capricious
confidence, even the gay laugh, sometimes.
Lawrence had a lively impression that
whatever Fanny said or did, she never
meant but one thing, whatever that
might be.  And with this impression
he was obliged to content himself.
</p>

<p>
From the place where he sat, he had
a glimpse between the trees of the
road below.  On the side towards him
there was a little open bit of meadow,
where the gorge widened, and a low
fence with a little ditch separated it
from the highway.  On the hillside,
above this stretch of grass, the trees
grew here and there, wide apart at
first, and then by degrees more close
together.  He himself was seated just
within the thick wood, at the edge of
the first underbrush.
</p>

<p>
Now and then, people passed along
the road: a light buckboard drawn by
a pair of bays and containing a
smart-looking couple, with no groom behind;
a farmer's wagon, long, hooded, and
dusty, dragged at a disjointed trot by a
broken-down grey horse; a solitary
rider, whose varnished shoes reflected
the sunlight even to where Lawrence
was sitting; a couple of pedestrians;
a lad driving a cow; and then another
buckboard; and so on.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence was thinking of shutting up
his book and climbing higher up the
steep side of New Port Mountain&mdash;as
the hill is called&mdash;in search of another
study, when, glancing down through the
trees, he saw three riders coming slowly
along the road&mdash;two in front, and one
at some distance behind&mdash;a lady and
gentleman and then a groom.  His
eyes were good, and he would have
known Fanny Trehearne's figure and
bearing even at a greater distance.
She sat so straight&mdash;hands down,
elbows in, head high, square in her
saddle, yet flexible, and all moving
with every movement of her Kentucky
thoroughbred.  They came nearer, and
Lawrence saw them distinctly now.
Brinsley was beside her.  Lawrence
laughed to himself at the idea that the
man could ever have been in the
Marines.  He sat the horse he rode much
more like a Mexican or an Indian than
like a sailor or a marine.  Even at that
distance Lawrence could not help
admiring his really magnificent figure, for
Brinsley's perfections were showy and
massed well afar off.
</p>

<p>
The riders reached the point where
the little meadow spread out on their
left, and to Lawrence's surprise, they
halted and seemed to be consulting
about something.  They had turned
towards him, and as they talked, he
could see that Fanny looked across the
meadow and up at the woods where he
was sitting.  It was of course utterly
impossible that she should have known
where he was, and it was almost
incredible that she should see him, seated
low upon the ground in the deep shade,
when she was only visible to him
between the stems of the trees.
Nevertheless, not caring to be discovered,
he crouched down amongst the ferns
and grasses, still keeping his eye on the
couple in the road far below.
</p>

<p>
Presently he saw Fanny turn her
horse's head, walk him to the other side
of the road, and turn again, facing the
meadow.  She looked up and down
the road once, saw that no one was
coming, and put her mare at the fence.
It was a low one, and the ditch on the
outer side was neither broad nor deep.
The thoroughbred cleared it with a
contemptuously insignificant effort, and
cantered a few strides forward into the
grass, shaking her bony head almost
between her knees as Fanny brought
her to a stand and turned again.  Brinsley
followed her on the big Hungarian
horse he rode,&mdash;Mr. Trehearne's
horse,&mdash;jumping the fence and ditch, and
taking them again almost immediately,
to wait for Fanny on the other side in
the road.  She followed again, and
pulled up by his side.  But they did
not ride on at once.  They seemed to
be discussing some point connected
with the place, for they pointed here
and there with their hands as they
spoke.  Fanny reined in her mare and
backed a little, as though she were going
to jump again.  The animal seemed
nervous, stamping and pawing, and
laying back her small ears.
</p>

<p>
A hundred yards or more in the
direction from which they had come the
road made a short bend round the
foot of the spur of the hill, known as
Pickett's.  Just as Fanny put the mare
at the fence a third time, a coach and
four turned the corner of the road at
a smart pace, leaders cantering and
wheelers at a long trot.
</p>

<p>
Seeing three horses apparently halting
in the way, some one in the coach
sent a terrific and discordant blast
from a post-horn ringing along the road
as a warning.  At that moment Fanny's
mare was rising at the bars.  She cleared
them as easily as ever, but on reaching
the ground instantly bolted across the
grass, head down, ears back, heels
flying.  It all happened in a moment.
The two men, Brinsley and groom,
knew too much to scare the thoroughbred
by a pursuit, and confident in
Fanny's good riding, sat motionless on
their horses in the road, after drawing
away enough to let the coach pass.
</p>

<p>
The idiot with the horn continued to
blow fiercely, and the big vehicle came
swinging along at a great rate, with
clattering of hoofs, for the road was
hard and dry, baked after a recent
rain&mdash;and with jingling of harness and
sound of voices.  The mare grew more
and more frightened, and tore up the
hillside like a flash, directly away from
the noise.  The young girl was a
first-rate rider and knew the fearful danger,
if she should be carried at such a pace
amongst the trees.  But her strength,
great as it was, for a woman, was
not able to produce the slightest impression
upon the terrified creature she rode.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence knew nothing of riding,
but the imminent peril of the woman
he loved was clear to him in a moment.
He had a horrible vision of the
wild-eyed mare tearing straight towards
him through the trees&mdash;wide apart at
first, and then dangerously near together.
</p>

<p>
On they came, the thoroughbred
swerving violently at one stem after
another&mdash;the young girl's strong figure
swaying to her balance at each
headlong movement.  He could see her
set face, pale under the tan, and he
could see the desperate exertion of
her strength.  He sprang forward and
ran down between the trees at the
top of his speed.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
</h3>

<p>
There is nothing equal to the absolute
fearlessness of a naturally brave
man who has no experience of the risk
he runs and is bent on saving the life of
the woman he loves.  Louis Lawrence
remembered afterwards what he had
done and how he had done it, but he
was unconscious of what he was doing
at the time.
</p>

<p>
He rushed down the hill between the
closer trees, and with utter recklessness
sprang at the bridle as the infuriated
mare dashed past him.  Grasping
snaffle and curb&mdash;tight drawn as they
were&mdash;in both hands, he threw all his
light weight upon them and allowed
himself to be dragged along the ground
between the trees at the imminent risk
of his life&mdash;a risk so terrible that
Fanny Trehearne turned paler for him
than for her own danger.  In half a
dozen more strides they might both
have been killed.  But the mare
stopped, quivering, tried to rear, but
could not lift Lawrence far from the
ground nor shake off his desperate
hold, plunged once and again, and
then stood quite still, trembling
violently.  Lawrence scrambled to his
feet, still holding the bridle, and
promptly placed himself in front of the
mare.
</p>

<p>
For one breathless instant, Lawrence
looked into Fanny's face, and neither
spoke nor moved.  Both were still very
pale.  Then the young girl slipped off,
the reins in her hand.
</p>

<p>
"That was uncommonly well done,"
she said, with great calm.  "You've
saved my life."
</p>

<p>
She no longer looked at him while
she spoke, but patted and stroked the
thoroughbred, looking her over with a
critical eye.
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;that's all right," answered
Lawrence.  "Don't mention it!"
</p>

<p>
He laughed nervously, still panting
from his violent exertion.  Fanny herself
was not out of breath, but the colour
did not come back to her sunburnt
cheeks at once, and her hand was
hardly steady yet.  She did not laugh
with Lawrence, nor even smile, but
she looked long into his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I may not mention it, but I shan't
forget it," she said slowly.
</p>

<p>
"It's one to me, isn't it?" asked
Lawrence, who, in reality, was by far
the cooler and more collected of the
two.
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean?" enquired
Fanny, knitting her brows half-angrily.
</p>

<p>
"One to me&mdash;in our game, you
know," said the young fellow.  "The
game we agreed to play, yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;it's one to you.  By the
bye&mdash;you're not hurt anywhere, are you?"
</p>

<p>
She looked him over, as she had
looked over her mare, with the same
critical glance.  His clothes were a
little torn, here and there, being but
light summer things, and his hat had
disappeared, but it was tolerably clear
that he was in no way injured.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm all right," he answered
cheerfully.  "I should think you'd feel
badly shaken, though," he added, with
sudden anxiety.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," said Fanny, determined
to show no more emotion or excitement
than he.  "It was a case of
sitting still&mdash;neck or nothing.  It's
nothing, as it happens."
</p>

<p>
At that moment Brinsley appeared,
riding slowly through the trees, for fear
of frightening the mare again.
</p>

<p>
"Are you hurt?" he shouted.
</p>

<p>
Fanny looked round, saw him, and
shook her head, with a smile.  Brinsley
trotted up and sprang from his horse.
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure you're not hurt?" he
asked again.
</p>

<p>
"Not in the least!"
</p>

<p>
"Thank God!" ejaculated Brinsley,
with emphasis.
</p>

<p>
"You'd better thank Mr. Lawrence,
too," observed Fanny, quietly.  "He
caught her going at a gallop, and hung
on and was dragged.  I don't remember
ever seeing anything quite so
plucky."
</p>

<p>
Brinsley looked coldly at his rival,
and his beady eyes seemed nearer
together than usual when he spoke to
him.
</p>

<p>
"I think you're quite as much to be
congratulated as Miss Trehearne," he
said.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks."
</p>

<p>
"We'd better be getting down to the
road again," said Fanny.  "You can
lead the mare and your own horse, too,
Mr. Brinsley.  She's quiet enough
now, and I've all I can do to walk in
these things."
</p>

<p>
Brinsley took the mare's bridle over
her head and led the way with the two
horses.
</p>

<p>
"Aren't you coming?" asked Fanny,
seeing that Lawrence did not follow.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks&mdash;no," he answered.  "I
must find my hat, in the first place."
</p>

<p>
Brinsley looked over his shoulder,
and saw the two hanging back.  He
stopped a moment, turning, and laying
one hand on the mare's nose.
</p>

<p>
"You must be shaken, Mr. Lawrence,"
he said.  "Why don't you take
the groom's horse and ride home with us?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't ride," answered the younger
man, loud enough for Brinsley to hear
him.  "And you know it perfectly
well," he added under his breath.
</p>

<p>
Fanny frowned, but took no further
notice of the remark.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye," she said, holding out
her hand to Lawrence.  "Come home
as soon as you can, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes&mdash;that is, I think I'll just
see you take that fence again, and then
I want to get a little higher up the hill
and do another bit of a sketch.  Then
I'll come home.  There's no hurry, is
there?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't show off," said Fanny, severely.
"It isn't pretty.  Good-bye."
</p>

<p>
She walked fast and overtook Brinsley
in a few moments.  At the foot of the
hill he prepared to mount her, leaving
his own horse to the groom.  Then a
thing happened which he was never able
to explain, though he was an expert in
the field and no one could mount a
lady better than he, of all Fanny's
acquaintances.  He bent his knee and
held out his hand and stiffened his
back and made the necessary effort
just at the right moment, as he very
well knew.  But for some inexplicable
reason Fanny did not reach the saddle,
nor anywhere near it, and she slipped
and would certainly have fallen if he
had not caught her with his other hand
and held her on her feet.
</p>

<p>
"How awkward you are!" she exclaimed
viciously, with a little stamp.
"Let me get on alone!"
</p>

<p>
And thereupon, to his astonishment
and mortification, she pushed him aside,
set her foot in the stirrup,&mdash;for she was
very tall and could do it easily,&mdash;and
was up in a flash.  Lawrence, looking
down at them from the edge of the
woods, saw what happened, and so did
Stebbins, the groom, who grinned in
silence.  He hated Brinsley, and it is
a bad sign when a good servant hates
his master's guest.  Lawrence felt that
in addition to scoring one in the
game, he was avenged on his enemy
for the latter's taunting invitation to
ride.
</p>

<p>
"I think I may count that, and mark
two.  I'm sure she did it on purpose,"
he said audibly to himself.
</p>

<p>
Before Brinsley was mounted, Fanny
was over the fence with her mare and
waiting for him in the road.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, come along!" she cried,
"Don't be all day getting on!"
</p>

<p>
"You needn't be so tremendously
rough on a fellow," said Brinsley, as his
horse landed in the road.  "It wasn't
my fault that I wasn't waiting for a
runaway under the trees up there."
</p>

<p>
"Yes it was!  Everything's your
fault," answered Fanny, emphatically.
"No&mdash;you needn't play Orlando
Furioso and make papa's old
rocking-horse waltz like that.  My mare's
got to walk a mile, at least, for her
nerves."
</p>

<p>
It didn't require Brinsley's great
natural penetration to tell him that Miss
Fanny Trehearne was in the very worst
of tempers&mdash;even to the point of
unfairly calling her papa's sturdy
Hungarian bad names.  But he could not at
all see why she should be so angry.  It
had certainly been her fault if he had
failed to put her neatly in the saddle.
But her ill-humour did not frighten
him in the least, though he was very
quiet for several minutes after she had
last spoken.
</p>

<p>
"It's not wildly gay to ride with
people who don't talk," observed Fanny.
</p>

<p>
"I was trying to think of something
appropriate to say," answered Brinsley.
"But you're in such an awful rage&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Am I?  I didn't know it.  What
makes you think so?"
</p>

<p>
"What nerves you've got!" exclaimed
Brinsley, in a tone of admiration.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't any nerves at all."
</p>

<p>
"I mean good nerves."
</p>

<p>
"I tell you I haven't any nerves.
Why do you talk about nerves?  They're
not amusing things to have, are they?"
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;in point of humour&mdash;I
didn't say they were."
</p>

<p>
"I asked you to say something
amusing, and you began talking about
nerves," said Fanny, in explanation.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not in luck to-day," said Brinsley,
after a pause.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;you're not," was the answer;
but she did not vouchsafe him a glance.
</p>

<p>
"I wish you'd like me," he said boldly.
</p>

<p>
"I do&mdash;at a certain distance.  You
look well in the landscape&mdash;and you
know it."
</p>

<p>
"Upon my word!"  Brinsley laughed
roughly, and looked between his horse's
ears.
</p>

<p>
"Upon your word&mdash;what?"
</p>

<p>
"I never had anything said to me
quite equal to that, Miss Trehearne."
</p>

<p>
"No?  I'm surprised.  Perhaps you
haven't known the right sort of people.
You must find the truth refreshing."
</p>

<p>
Brinsley waited a few moments before
speaking, and then, turning his
head, looked at her with great earnestness.
</p>

<p>
"I wish you'd tell me why you've
taken such a sudden dislike to me," he
said in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"Why are you so anxious to know,
Mr. Brinsley?" asked Fanny, meeting
his eyes quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Because I believe that somebody
has been saying disagreeable things
about me to you," he answered.  "If
that's the case, it would be fair to give
me a chance, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Nobody's been talking against you.
You've talked against yourself.
Besides," she added, her face suddenly
clearing, "it's quite absurd to make
such a fuss about nothing!  I'm only
angry about nothing at all.  It's my
way, you know.  You mustn't mind.
I'll get over it before we're at home,
and then I'll go off, and my cousins will
give you lots of weak tea and flattery."
</p>

<p>
Brinsley, who was clever at most
things, was not good at talking nor at
understanding a woman's moods, and he
felt himself at so great a disadvantage
that he slipped into an inane conversation
about people and parties without
succeeding in finding out what he wished
to know.  If he had ever conceived
any mad hope of winning Fanny's
affections, he abandoned it then and
there.  He was still further
handicapped, had Fanny known it, by the
desperate state of his own affairs at
that moment; and if she had known
something of his reflexions, she might
have pitied him a little&mdash;what she
might have thought, if she had guessed
the remainder, is hard to guess, for he
had a very curious scheme in his mind
for improving his finances.  He had
been playing high for some time, had
lost steadily, and was at the end of his
present resources, which, with him,
meant that he was at the end of all he
had in the world.
</p>

<p>
He was not by any means inclined
to give up the pleasant intimacy he had
formed and fostered with the three
Miss Miners, nor the attendant luxuries
which he had gained with it, and the
introduction to Bar Harbour society,
which meant good society elsewhere.
But he felt that he had no choice, since
the cards went against him.  He was
not a sharper.  He played fair, for the
sake of the enjoyment of the thing.  It
was his one great passion.  When he
was in luck he won enough for his
extravagant needs, for he always played
high, on principle.  But when fortune
foiled him, he had other talents of a
more curious description, by the exercise
of which to replenish his purse&mdash;talents,
too, which he had exercised in
America for a long time.  His happy
hunting-ground was really London,
which accounted for his evident and
almost extraordinary familiarity with its
ways.  There are indeed few places in
the world where a man may follow a
doubtful occupation more freely and
more successfully.
</p>

<p>
Before they reached the Trehearnes'
house, Brinsley had made up his mind
that he must drink his last cup of tea
with the three Miss Miners on that day
or very soon afterwards, unless he were
to be even more fortunate in his
undertaking than he dared to expect.  The
immediate consequence was an affectation
of a sad and stately manner towards
Fanny as he helped her off her mare at
the door.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid this has been our last
ride," he said, in a subdued voice.
</p>

<p>
"What?  Oh&mdash;'The Last Ride'&mdash;Browning&mdash;I
remember," answered
Fanny.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;I wasn't alluding to Browning.
I'm going away very soon."
</p>

<p>
Fanny stared at him in some surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Are you?  I am very sorry."  She
spoke cheerfully, and led the way
into the house, Brinsley following her,
with a dejected air.  "You'll probably
find my cousins in the library," she
added.  "I'm going to take off my
hat&mdash;it's so hot."
</p>

<p>
The three Miss Miners were assembled,
as usual at that hour, and greeted
Brinsley effusively.  Not wishing to be
anticipated by Fanny in telling a story
altogether to Lawrence's credit, he
began to tell the three ladies of what
had happened during the ride.  He
was very careful to explain that he had
of course not dared to follow the
run-away, lest he should have made matters
much worse.
</p>

<p>
"It's quite dreadful," cried Miss
Cordelia, on hearing of Fanny's narrow
escape.  "You should never have let
her jump the fence at all.  What do
people do such mad things for!"
</p>

<p>
"If anything happened to the child,
we might as well kill ourselves," said
Elizabeth.  "It's too dreadful to think of!"
</p>

<p>
"Well," answered Brinsley, "nothing
has happened, you see.  I've brought
Miss Trehearne safe home, though I
hadn't the good fortune to be the man
who stopped her horse.  You see," he
added, smiling, "I want all the credit
you can spare from Mr. Lawrence.  I'm
afraid there's not much to be got,
though.  He's had the lion's share."
</p>

<p>
"And where is he?" asked Augusta,
who felt more sympathy for the artist
than the others.
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;he'll come back.  He can't
ride, you know, so he had to walk, poor
fellow!  He'd been pretty badly shaken,
too, and he's not strong, I'm sure."
</p>

<p>
"You wouldn't have called him weak
if you'd seen him hanging on while the
mare dragged him," said Fanny, who
had entered unnoticed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's only strength in the
hands!" said Brinsley, in a depreciative
tone, and conscious of his own
splendid proportions.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, he's strong in the hands,
that's all," retorted Fanny.  "Please,
some tea, Elizabeth dear&mdash;I'm half
dead."
</p>

<p>
The three Miss Miners did their best
to console Brinsley for Fanny's
continued ill-treatment of him, but they
did not succeed in lifting the cloud from
his brow.  At last he confessed that he
was expecting to leave Bar Harbour at
any moment.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
</h3>

<p>
There were to be fireworks that
evening at the Canoe Club on the farther
side of Bar Island&mdash;magnificent
fireworks, it was said, which it would be
well worth while to see.  The night
was calm and clear, and the moon,
being near the last quarter, would not
rise until everything was over.
</p>

<p>
"We'll go in skiffs," said Fanny.
"When we're tired of each other, we
can change about, you know.
Mr. Lawrence can take one of us and
Mr. Brinsley another, and the other two
must take one of the men from the
landing.  I ordered the boats this
morning when I was out."
</p>

<p>
The three Miss Miners looked
consciously at one another, mutely
wondering how they were to divide
Mr. Brinsley amongst them, and wishing
that they had consulted together in
private before the moment for decision
had come.  But no one suggested
that, as there were only four ladies,
each of the men could very easily take
two in a boat.
</p>

<p>
"We might toss up to see who shall
take whom," suggested Brinsley, who
had been unusually silent during the
greater part of dinner.
</p>

<p>
"In how many ways can you arrange
six people in couples?" asked Fanny.
</p>

<p>
Nobody succeeded in solving the
question, of course.  Even Elizabeth
Miner, who was considered the clever
member, gave it up in despair.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind!" said Fanny.  "We'll
see how it turns out when we get down
to the landing-stage.  These things
always arrange themselves."
</p>

<p>
To the surprise of every one except
Fanny herself, the arrangement turned
out to be such that she and Miss
Cordelia went together in the skiff pulled
by the sailor, while Brinsley and
Lawrence each took one of the other Miss
Miners.
</p>

<p>
"We'll change by and by," said
Fanny, as her boat shoved off first to
show the way.  "Keep close to us in
the crowd when we get over."
</p>

<p>
The distance from the landing, across
the harbour, through the channel
between Bar Island and Sheep Porcupine
to the Canoe Club, is little over half a
mile; but at night, amidst a crowd of
steamers, large and small, row-boats,
canoes, and sail-boats,&mdash;the latter all
outside the channel,&mdash;it took twenty
minutes to reach the place where the
fireworks were to be.
</p>

<p>
Fanny leaned back beside her
cousin, and watched the lights in
silence.  Yellow, green, and red, they
streamed across the brilliant black
water in every direction, the yellow
rays fixed or moving but slowly, the
others gliding along swiftly above their
own reflection, as the paddle steamers
thrashed their way through the still
sea.  To left and right the shadowy
islands loomed, darkly against the black
sky, outlined by the stars.  The warm
damp air lifted the coolness from the
water in little puffs, as the skiff slipped
along.  Now and then, in the gloom,
a boat showed dimly alongside, and
the laughing voices of girls and boys
told how near it passed, a mere
floating dimness upon blackness.  The
stroke of light sculls swished and tinkled
with the laughter.  The soft mysterious
charm of the summer dark was
breathed upon land and water&mdash;the
distant lights were love-dreaming eyes,
and each time, as the oars dipped,
swept and rose, the gentle sound was
like a stolen kiss.
</p>

<p>
Then, suddenly, with a wild screaming
rush, a rocket shot up into the
night, splitting the sky with a scar of
fire.  The burning point of it lingered
a moment overhead, then cracked into
little stars that shed a soft glow through
the gloom, and fell in a swift shower
of sparks.  Then all was hushed again,
and the red and green lights moved
quickly over the water, hither and
thither.
</p>

<p>
Close to the shore of the island the
skiff ran round the point into the
shallow water along the beach, and all
at once in the distance the festooned
lanterns of the Canoe Club came into
view, so bright that one could distinguish
the branches of the spruces in the
red and yellow glare, and the moving
crowd of people on the little
landing-stage and below, before the
clubhouse.  And some two hundred yards
out the lights began again, gleaming
from hundreds of boats and little
vessels of all rigs and builds.  Between
these seaward lights and those on land
a deep black void stretched away up
Frenchman's Bay.
</p>

<p>
Miss Cordelia started nervously at
the rockets, but said nothing.  Fanny
sat beside her in silence.  The sailor,
only visible distinctly when the lights
were behind him, pulled softly and
steadily, glancing over his shoulder
every now and then to see that the
way was clear.  The other skiffs kept
near, both Brinsley and Lawrence
being keenly on the lookout for a
change.  Now and then Fanny could
hear them talking.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder why one voice should
attract one and another should be
disagreeable," she said at last, in a
meditative tone.
</p>

<p>
"I was thinking of the same thing,"
answered Cordelia, thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Fanny, absently.  "Of
course you were," she added, a moment
later.  "I mean&mdash;"  She paused.  "Poor
dear!" she exclaimed at last, stroking
her cousin's elderly hand in the dark.
"I'm so sorry!"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, dear," answered Miss
Miner, simply and gratefully.
</p>

<p>
It was little enough, but little as it
was it made them both more silent than
ever.  With the boatman close before
them, it was impossible to talk of what
was in their thoughts.  Fanny, for her
part, was glad of it.  She had
understood her old-maid cousin since the
night when Cordelia had broken down
and laughed and cried in the garden,
and she knew how little there could be
to say.  But Cordelia did not
understand Fanny in the least.  It was a
marvel to her that any one should
prefer Lawrence to Brinsley&mdash;almost as
great a marvel as that she herself, in
her sober middle age, should have felt
what she knew was love and believed
to be passion.
</p>

<p>
And now, Brinsley was going, and it
was over.  He would never come back,
and she should never see him again&mdash;she
was sure of that.  She was only an
old maid; a middle-aged gentlewoman
who had never possessed any great
attraction for anybody; who had always
been more or less poor and unhappy,
though of the best and living amongst
the best; whose few pleasures had
come to her unexpectedly, like rare
gleams of pale sunshine on a very long
rainy day; who had looked for little
and had got next to nothing out of life,
save the crumbs of enjoyment from the
feast of rich relations, like the
Trehearnes&mdash;a woman who had known
something more grievous than sorrow
and worse than violent grief, trudging
through life in the leaden cowl of many
limitations&mdash;the leaden cowl of that
most innocent of all hypocrites, of her,
or of him, who knows the daily burden
of keeping up appearances on next to
nothing, and of doctoring poor little
illusions through a feeble existence,
worth having because they represent
all that there is to have.
</p>

<p>
She had been wounded by one of
those arrows shot in the dark which hit
hearts unawares and unaimed; and now
that the shaft was suddenly drawn out,
the heart's blood followed it and the
nerves quivered where it had been.  It
was only one of the little tragedies
which no one sees, few guess at, and
nothing can hinder.  But Fanny Trehearne
felt that it was beside her, there
in the little boat, while she watched
the pretty fireworks, and she was sorry
and did what she could to soothe the
pain.
</p>

<p>
"Let's change, now," she said at last,
just as the glow of a multitude of
coloured fires died away on the water.
"You take Mr. Brinsley, and I'll take
Mr. Lawrence."
</p>

<p>
As she spoke, she gave her cousin's
hand a little squeeze of sympathy, and
heard the small sigh of satisfaction that
answered the proposal.  The rearrangement
was effected in a few moments,
the men holding the boats together by
the gunwales while the ladies stepped
from one into the other.
</p>

<p>
"Pull away," said Fanny, authoritatively,
as soon as Lawrence had shoved
off.  "Let's get out of this!  I'll steer,
so you needn't bother about running
into things."
</p>

<p>
Fairly seated in a boat, with the sculls
shipped, and some one at the tiller lines,
Lawrence could get along tolerably well,
for he knew just enough not to catch a
crab in smooth water, so long as he
was not obliged to turn his head.  But
if he had to look over his shoulder,
something was certain to happen, which
was natural, considering that when he
attempted to feather at all, he did it
the wrong way.
</p>

<p>
"You're stronger than anybody would
think," observed Fanny, as she saw how
quickly the skiff moved.  "You might
do things quite decently, if you'd only
take the trouble to learn."
</p>

<p>
"Oh no!  I'm a born duffer,"
laughed Lawrence.  "Besides, I couldn't
row long like this.  I couldn't keep it up."
</p>

<p>
They were just in front of the
clubhouse now; and a score of rockets
went up together, with a rushing and
a crackling and a gleaming, as they
soared and burst, and at last fell
sputtering in the water all around the skiff.
Lawrence had rested on his sculls to
watch the sight.
</p>

<p>
"Pull away!" said Fanny.  "We'll
get under the foot-bridge by the
landing.  There's water enough there, and
we can see everything."
</p>

<p>
Lawrence obeyed, and pulled as hard
as he could.
</p>

<p>
"So your friend Mr. Brinsley is going
away," observed the young girl, suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"My friend!  I like that!  As though
I had brought him in my pocket."
</p>

<p>
"I'm very glad that he's going, at
all events," said Fanny, without heeding
his remark.  "I'm not fond of him
any more."
</p>

<p>
"I hope you never were&mdash;fond of him."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, I was&mdash;but I'm thankful
to say that it's over.  Of all the ineffable
cads!  I could have killed him to-day!"
</p>

<p>
"By the bye," said Lawrence, "when
he was mounting you&mdash;didn't you do
that on purpose?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course.  And then I called him
awkward.  It was so nice!  It did me
good."
</p>

<p>
"Pure spite, I suppose.  You couldn't
have had any particular reason for
doing it, could you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh dear, no!  What reason could
I have?  It wasn't his fault that the
mare ran away, though I told him it
was."
</p>

<p>
"That's interesting," observed
Lawrence.  "Do you often do things out
of pure spite?"
</p>

<p>
"Constantly&mdash;without any reason
at all!" Fanny laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you'll marry out of spite,
some day," said Lawrence, calmly.
"Women often do, they say, though I
never could understand why."
</p>

<p>
"I daresay I shall.  I'm quite capable
of it.  And shouldn't I be just horrid
afterwards!"
</p>

<p>
"I like you when you're horrid, as
you call it.  I didn't at first.  You've
given my sense of humour a chance to
grow since I've been here.  I say, Miss
Trehearne&mdash;"  He stopped.
</p>

<p>
"What do you say?  It isn't particularly
polite to begin in that way, is it?
I suppose it's English."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, bother the English!  And I
apologize for being slangy.  It's so
dark that I can't see you frown.  I
meant to say, if you ever marry out of
spite, and want to be particularly horrid
afterwards, it wouldn't be a bad idea
to marry me, for I don't mind that sort
of thing a bit, you know."
</p>

<p>
"That's a singular offer!" laughed
Fanny, leaning far back, and playing
with the tiller lines in the glow of the
Bengal lights.
</p>

<p>
"It's genuine of its kind," answered
the young man.  "Of course it isn't a
sure thing, exactly," he added
reflectively, "because it depends on your
happening to be in the spiteful humour.
But, as you say that often happens&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, go on!"
</p>

<p>
"I thought you might feel spiteful
enough to accept this evening,"
concluded Lawrence.
</p>

<p>
"Take care&mdash;I might, you know&mdash;you're
in danger!"  She was still laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Don't mind me, you know!  I
could stand it, I believe."
</p>

<p>
"You're awfully amusing&mdash;sometimes,
Mr. Lawrence."
</p>

<p>
"Meaning now?" enquired the artist,
resting on his sculls, for they were under
the shadow of the bridge.
</p>

<p>
"I can't see your face distinctly,"
answered Fanny.  "So much depends
on the expression.  But I think&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What do you think?  That it's
awfully amusing of me to offer to be
married as a sacrifice to your spite?"
</p>

<p>
"It's amusing anyway."
</p>

<p>
"A formal proposal would be, you
mean?" asked Lawrence.  Then he
laughed oddly.
</p>

<p>
"I hate formality," answered Fanny.
"That is, in earnest, you know.  It's
so disgusting when a man comes with
his gloves buttoned and sits on the
edge of a chair and says&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And says what?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;you know the sort of thing.
You must have done it scores of times."
</p>

<p>
"What?  Proposed and been refused?
You're complimentary, at all
events.  I've a great mind to let you
be the first, just&mdash;well&mdash;how shall I
say?  Just to associate you with a
novel sensation."
</p>

<p>
"I might disappoint you," said
Fanny, demurely.  "I told you so before.
Just think, if I were to say 'yes,'
you'd be most dreadfully caught.  You'd
have to eat humble pie and beg off,
and say that you hadn't meant it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh no!" laughed the young man.
"You'd break it off in a week, and
then it would be all right."
</p>

<p>
"Are you going to be rude?  Or are
you, already?  I'm not quite sure."
</p>

<p>
"Neither.  Of course you'd break
it off, if we had an agreement to that
effect."
</p>

<p>
"You don't make any allowance for
my spitefulness.  It would be just like
me to hold you to your engagement.
Of course you wouldn't live long.  We
should be sure to fight."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;sure," assented Lawrence.
"That is, if you call this fighting."
</p>

<p>
"It would be worse than this.  But
why don't you try?  I'm dying to
refuse you.  I'm just in the humour."
</p>

<p>
"Why!  I thought you said there was
danger!  If I'd known there wasn't&mdash;by
the bye, this counts in the game,
doesn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"There isn't anything to count, yet,"
said Fanny.  "Look at those fiery
fish&mdash;aren't they pretty?  See how they
squirm about, and fizzle, and behave
like mad things!  Oh, I never saw
anything so pretty as that!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  If one must have an
interruption, they do as well as anything."
</p>

<p>
"You weren't talking very coherently,
I believe," said the young girl,
turning her head to watch the fireworks.
"And you've made me miss lots of
pretty things, I'm sure.  Oh&mdash;they've
gone out already!  How dark it seems,
all at once!  What were you asking?
Whether this counted in the game?
Of course it counts.  Everything does.
But I don't exactly see how&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She stopped and looked towards him
in the dim gloom of the shadow under
the bridge.  But Lawrence did not
speak.  He looked over the side of
the boat, softly slapping the black
water with the blade of his scull.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you go on?" asked
Fanny, tapping the boards under her
foot to attract his attention.
</p>

<p>
"I was thinking over the proper
words," answered Lawrence.  "How
does one make a formal proposal of
marriage?  I never did such a thing in
my life."
</p>

<p>
"An informal one would do for fun."
</p>

<p>
"I never did that, either."
</p>

<p>
"Never?"
</p>

<p>
"Never."
</p>

<p>
"Really?  Swear it, as they say on
the stage."  Fanny laughed softly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, by Jove, yes!" answered Lawrence,
promptly.  "I'll swear to that
by anything you please."
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;you'll have to do it some
day, so you'd better practise at once,"
suggested Fanny.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence did not notice that there
was a sort of little relief in her tone.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose one says, 'My angel,
will you be mine?'" he said.  "That
sounds like some book or other."
</p>

<p>
"It might do," answered Fanny,
meditatively.  "You ought to throw a
little more expression into the tone.
Besides, I'm not an angel, whatever
the girl in the book may have been.
On the whole&mdash;no&mdash;it's a little too
effusive.  Angel&mdash;you know.  It's such
nonsense!  Try something else; but
put lots of expression into it."
</p>

<p>
"Does one get down on one's
knees?" enquired Lawrence.
</p>

<p>
"Oh no; I don't believe it's necessary.
Besides, you'd upset the boat."
</p>

<p>
"All right&mdash;here goes!  My dear
Miss Trehearne, will you&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  That's it.  Go on.  The
quaver in the voice is rather well done.
'Will you&mdash;'  What?"
</p>

<p>
"Will you marry me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mr. Lawrence, I will."
</p>

<p>
There was a short pause, during
which a number of fiery fish were sent
off again, and squirmed and wriggled
and fizzled their burning little lives
away in the water.  But neither of the
young people looked at them.
</p>

<p>
"You rather took my breath away,"
said Lawrence, with a change of tone.
"Did I do it all right?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;quite right," answered Fanny,
thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
Immediately after the words Lawrence
heard a little sigh.  Then Fanny
heard one, too.
</p>

<p>
"You didn't happen to be in earnest,
did you?" she asked suddenly, in a
low, soft voice.
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;I didn't mean&mdash;that I
meant&mdash;you know we agreed to play
a game&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I know we did&mdash;but&mdash;were you
in earnest."
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;but, of course&mdash;  Oh, this
isn't fair, Miss Trehearne!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is.  I said 'yes,' didn't I?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There's no 'but.'  I happened to
be in earnest, too&mdash;that's all.  I've
lost the game."
</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
